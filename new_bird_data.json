It exhibits a gray-white throat, a white center on the belly, and olive-colored flanks. Rusty undertail coverts further characterize this species. Both male and female birds share similar appearances, featuring a short tail and a sturdy bill. The overall plumage is a subdued olive-brown, complemented by vibrant rusty lower flanks and vent, a grayish-white throat and breast, and a variable pale gray supercilium and lores. Juvenile birds display dark rufescent-brown crowns and upperparts. The distinctive calls of Abbott's babblers set them apart. The Eastern Ghats subspecies, M. a. krishnarajui, distinguishes itself with a darker russet tail and rump compared to the Himalayan nominate subspecies. Measurements indicate specimens are approximately 12\u201313 cm (4.7\u20135.1 in) in length, with a head size ranging from 39\u201344 mm (1.5\u20131.7 in), and a tail length of 55\u201361 mm (2.2\u20132.4 in).","bird_distr":"Abbott's babbler is a bird commonly found in various places, including Nepal, Arunachal Pradesh, and the Assam Valley in India. It also resides in parts of Bangladesh and the Eastern Ghats in northeast Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. This bird is adaptable and can be seen in different environments, such as the understory of forests, forest edges, secondary growth areas, and scrublands. It's often found in regions up to 600 meters (2,000 feet) high, and it's widely distributed in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, it has been observed to tolerate disturbances and thrive in secondary growth and disturbed forest areas.","bird_eco":"Abbott's babbler is a bird that usually moves around in pairs close to the ground. They typically breed from April to July during the summer monsoon. The nests are carefully placed, bulky cups located low in palms or other undergrowth, often in spiny palms and rattans, as observed in a study in Thailand.\n\nDuring the breeding season, the female lays a usual clutch of 3 to 5 eggs, which are bright salmon with dark blotches and red lines. If disturbed at the nest, the birds exhibit a unique behavior, slipping over the edge and flying with labored wing beats before hopping out of sight. It's not uncommon for them to raise more than one brood in a season.\n\nThe distinctive calls of Abbott's babbler consist of three or four notes with a drop on the middle note. The male and female engage in an antiphonal duet, with the male leading with a \"poor'ol bear,\" followed by the female's \"dear dear.\" The tunes may change over time. These birds tend to stay within a well-marked area and do not wander widely.\n\nTheir song is a variable short series of around three to four notes, described as rich, fluty, liquid, slurred, short whistled notes, sometimes delivered haltingly and sometimes rapidly. The evening group song includes a recurrent sputtering \"churrr\" sound, low and slurred, ending with a sharp \"chreep.\" Calls may also include soft mewing notes and a pulsing, purring trill when agitated.","bird_img":["abbottsbabbler.jpeg"],"bird_scale":1}

These birds can stretch up to 80 cm (31 in) from beak to tail and tip the scales at approximately 1.5 kg (3.3 lb). What distinguishes them is their striking black and white plumage. The only other bird in the region with a similar look is the masked booby, which, in contrast, has an all-white body with black wings only.\n\nThe Abbott's booby features off-white plumage with black eye patches, wings, tails, and flank marks. Their feet are notable for being blue and webbed, with black outer ends. Males sport pale grey bills with a black tip, while females exhibit pink bills with a black tip. Chicks, on the other hand, are covered in white down and have a distinctive cape of black scapular feathers.\n\nAn interesting point is that juvenile Abbott's boobies have plumage similar to adults, setting them apart from other booby species.","bird_distr":"Abbott's booby holds a unique status among boobies, as it is the only one confined to a specific location. While it once had a more extensive distribution across the Indian and Pacific Oceans, it is now limited to a singular habitat. Fossil evidence suggests its historical presence in the South Pacific, and there are eyewitness reports of it previously breeding on the Mascarene Islands.\n\nNotably, in April 2007, a member of this species was photographed at a booby colony on Rota in the Pacific Ocean. Surprisingly, the same individual has been intermittently observed in the red-footed booby colony on Rota through at least 2024.\n\nThe breeding grounds of Abbott's booby are in tall trees within the plateau forests of Christmas Island's central and western areas, as well as the upper terrace forests along the north coast. Nest distribution is influenced by the topography, with a concentration in trees on uneven terrain. These birds typically construct nests on Syzygium nervosum and Planchonella nitida trees, although occasionally they use emergent Tristiropsis acutangula trees. The northwest approachability of trees is favored, likely influenced by the southeast trade winds from April to November.\n\nTheir foraging range extends approximately 40\u2013100 km (25\u201362 mi) from Christmas Island, although individuals are frequently spotted in Indonesia, and occasional vagrants have been recorded as far as mainland Australia. There is even recent observation of a lone female on Rota, northeast of Guam in the Pacific, and records from the Banda Sea hint at a potentially larger range or undiscovered breeding colonies.","bird_eco":"\nThe Abbott's booby population stands out as both the best-documented and the smallest among all sulid populations. Its assessment began in 1967, revealing an initial estimate of 2,300 breeding pairs. However, by 1983, this number had declined to 1,900. The most comprehensive survey in 1991, which discovered new breeding sites, increased the estimate to 2,500 breeding pairs, with a total of 6,000 mature individuals. Despite a stable population from 1991 to 2002, a helicopter survey in 2002 noted 1,500 nest sites.\n\nSadly, the population is projected to decrease by more than 80% over the next three generations or 120 years. This decline is attributed to a low recruitment rate and the adverse effects of wind turbulence on the breeding population. Given its small population, limited habitat, low fecundity, and restricted distribution, the Abbott's booby faces a high risk of extinction if further habitat disturbance occurs.\n\nIndividual Abbott's boobies are solitary, long-distance travelers that can cover thousands of kilometers from Christmas Island. They are highly vocal, with a diverse range of calls. Due to their size, they need a large clear space for takeoff, so they nest near the tops of trees. If an individual falls to the forest floor, it faces starvation unless it can climb high enough to catch the wind and take off. Adult Abbott's boobies rarely engage in fights due to the risk of falling. Fledglings must succeed in their first attempt at flight, as unsuccessful attempts rarely lead to their survival.\n\nDuring the breeding season, courtship involves a face-to-face display, and pairs mate for life, maintaining the same nest site throughout their lives. Nests are built near the top of rainforest trees, 10\u201340 m (33\u2013131 ft) off the ground. Breeding cycles last 15\u201318 months, with only one egg laid during each cycle. Successful pairs can nest once every two years, often taking rest years between attempts. Most pairs only breed once every three years.\n\nMating usually occurs in April, and eggs are laid between April and July. The eggs, equal to 8% of the female's body weight, are incubated under the webbed feet of the parents, which become vascularized and warm. Incubation is undertaken by both parents, taking shifts of up to two days. The incubation period is about 56 days, 30 days longer than in other sulids. Chicks hatch from June to November, taking 170 days to fully fledge and an additional 200 days to become fully independent. Most chicks make their first flight in December or January. Fledglings reach maturity around eight years of age and can live up to 40 years.","bird_img":["abbottsbooby.jpg"],"bird_scale":6}

Adult males boast a distinctive patch of bare blue skin around the eye and an inflatable area of bare skin on the neck and throat, colored red with the upper throat in blue. The bill is long and black, except for a reddish patch at the base of the mandible, and there's a short open-ended black casque on top of the bill. Females resemble males but are smaller, with any bare skin being entirely dark blue. Juvenile birds initially have a dark sooty-brown appearance with a smaller bill, featuring an incipient casque. Over about three years, as the juvenile matures, it gradually acquires the plumage, bare skin color, and casque of the adults. The total length ranges from 90 to 110 cm (35 to 43 in).\n\nNotably, the Abyssinian ground hornbill possesses long feathers resembling eyelashes around its eyes, serving as protection against injuries.\n\nReportedly, the bird stands around 90 to 100 cm (35 to 39 in) tall, with a wingspan of approximately 110 cm (43 in), and weighs around 4 kg (8.8 lb). There are variations in the reported size compared to the southern ground hornbill, with some sources indicating the Abyssinian as larger on average, while others suggest the southern species is slightly larger.\n\nIn terms of vocalizations, the Abyssinian ground hornbill produces a deep booming uh-uh, uh-uh-uh sound that carries far, typically heard at dawn from a perch or the ground. Both male and female birds engage in duet singing.","bird_distr":"The Abyssinian ground hornbill is found in Northern sub-Saharan Africa, stretching from southern Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea to Eritrea, Ethiopia, northwestern Somalia, northwestern Kenya, and Uganda. These birds prefer open areas like savannas and rocky spots, with short vegetation that suits their way of finding food. They can handle some disturbance but need large trees for nesting.\n\nInterestingly, some Abyssinian ground hornbills have ended up in Florida, USA, either by escaping or being intentionally released. However, there's no clear evidence that they are breeding there, and their presence may be due to ongoing releases or escapes.","bird_eco":"The Abyssinian ground hornbill prefers living in open grassy areas in pairs or small family groups. They like to walk instead of fly in their territory, which is usually when they feel threatened. In captivity, they can live up to 35\u201340 years.\n\nIn the wild, they eat a mix of things like small animals (tortoises, lizards, snakes, birds, spiders, beetles, and caterpillars), carrion, some fruits, seeds, and groundnuts. They have territories ranging from 2 to 100 square miles and are active during the day.\n\nWhen it comes to breeding, Abyssinian ground hornbills have different breeding seasons depending on where they are. In West Africa, they breed from June to August, in Nigeria and Uganda in January, and in Kenya as late as November. They like nesting in large trees, especially baobabs and palm stumps, making nests in cavities. Unlike other hornbills, the female is not completely sealed in during nesting. The male prepares the nest, and the female lays one or two eggs over about five days. It takes 37 to 41 days for the eggs to hatch, and during that time, the male brings food to the female. The first chick that hatches usually has a better chance of surviving, while the second one typically doesn't make it past four days old. The surviving chick leaves the nest after 80 to 90 days.\n\nAbyssinian ground hornbills invest a lot in their offspring, with young ones staying with their parents for up to three years. They don't reproduce quickly, with only one chick raised to adulthood every 9 years, making the adults' investment in each young bird quite high.\n\nAs opportunistic eaters, they follow herds of ungulates and forest fires to catch small animals disturbed by larger animals or flames. They can walk up to 11 km in a day, catching and eating animals they come across. They've also been seen digging for arthropods in the soil and attacking beehives for honeycomb, with their diet rarely including plant matter. Their strong bill is a crucial tool for catching and dealing with prey before eating.","bird_img":["abyssiniangroundhornbill.jpg"],"bird_scale":6}

Its body is mostly grey, with predominantly white wings that have feathers in various colors. There's a distinct black patch at the top of the wings. The head has a crown of stiff golden feathers, white sides on the face, and a bright red inflatable throat pouch. The bill is relatively short and grey, and the legs are black. They have long legs adapted for wading through grass, and their large but slender feet are designed for balance rather than defense or grasping. Both males and females look similar, but males are slightly larger. Younger cranes are greyer than adults and have a buff face covered in feathers.\n\nThis crane and the black crowned crane are the only cranes that can roost in trees, thanks to a long hind toe that can grasp branches. This trait is thought to be an ancestral feature among cranes, which has been lost in the other subfamily. Crowned cranes also differ from other cranes by lacking a coiled trachea and having loose plumage.","bird_distr":"The grey crowned crane is commonly found in dry savannah areas across Sub-Saharan Africa, although it nests in somewhat wetter environments. They can also be spotted in marshes, cultivated lands, and grassy flatlands near rivers and lakes, extending from Uganda and Kenya down to South Africa. Unlike having set migration patterns, these birds nearer to the tropics usually stay in one place throughout the year. However, those in more arid regions, especially in Namibia, tend to make localized seasonal movements during drier periods.","bird_eco":"The grey crowned crane engages in a distinctive breeding display that includes dancing, bowing, and jumping. This display is accompanied by a booming call, involving the inflation of the red gular sac. Their honking sound sets them apart from other crane species. Both males and females partake in this dance, and even immature birds join in. While dancing is a significant part of courtship, these displays can happen at any time of the year.\n\nFlocks of 30 to 150 birds are not unusual.\n\nIn terms of diet, these cranes are omnivores, consuming plants, seeds, grain, insects, frogs, worms, snakes, small fish, and the eggs of aquatic animals. They stamp their feet as they walk to flush out insects, quickly catching and eating them. They also associate with grazing herbivores, benefiting from prey items disturbed by antelopes and gazelles. The crowned crane spends its entire day foraging for food and, during the night, takes refuge in trees for sleep and rest.\n\nGrey crowned cranes time their breeding season around the rains, with variations in different regions. In East Africa, they breed throughout the year, more frequently during drier periods. In Southern Africa, the breeding season aligns with the rains. During breeding, crane pairs construct large nests in tall wetland vegetation. The female lays a clutch of 2-5 glossy, dirty-white eggs, incubated by both parents for 28\u201331 days. The chicks are precocial, capable of running as soon as they hatch, and fledge in 56\u2013100 days. Once fully grown, chicks of different sexes separate from their parents to start their own families. Interestingly, grey crowned cranes have been observed gathering in large numbers in a ceremony resembling a wedding when two chicks are being \"married off.\" The new couple engages in a dance before flying away together to begin their own family.","bird_img":["greycrownedcrane.jpeg"],"bird_scale":6}

While the African firefinch can occasionally be spotted in and around gardens and rural villages, it's not as commonly found in these locations compared to some other firefinch species.","bird_eco":"Food and Feeding:\nThe African firefinch primarily sustains itself on seeds, occasionally complemented with insects. Its foraging activity mainly takes place on the ground, where it sifts through the soil in search of food. Typically, these birds are found in pairs or small family groups, sometimes mingling with other firefinches. They tend to stay close to cover and swiftly retreat into it if they sense any alarm.\n\nBreeding:\nThe male takes charge of building the nest, which is a round structure featuring a side entrance. The outer shell is made up of long, dry grass blades, while the inner shell consists of soft grass inflorescences, occasionally lined with feathers. Nest locations are typically hidden deep within long, thick grass, bracken-briar undergrowth, or grass growing amidst fallen branches or tree stumps. In southern Africa, the 2-5 eggs are laid between November and June, peaking from January to April. Further north, breeding occurs later in the year. Both male and female share the responsibility of incubating the eggs, which takes about 12 days. Once hatched, the chicks are cared for by both parents for 2\u20133 weeks until fledging. After this period, the parents continue to feed the chicks for an additional 10 days until they become fully independent.

These areas are typically found on or near rocky shores, providing suitable locations for both feeding and nesting activities.","bird_eco":"Feeding:\nAfrican oystercatchers primarily dine on mollusks such as mussels and limpets, though they are also documented feeding on polychaetes, insects, and possibly even fish. Their specialized adaptations allow them to pry open mussels, loosen limpets from rocks, and even sift through sand to find other food items.\n\nBreeding:\nThe nesting habits of African oystercatchers involve creating a bare scrape on pebbles, sand, or shingle within approximately 30 meters (98 feet) of the high-water mark. On rock ledges, there may be a rim of shells to keep the eggs in place. Females typically lay two eggs, although there may be one or three, and both adults share the incubation responsibilities. The incubation period varies from 27 to 39 days, and the young take an additional approximately 38 days to fledge. Breeding success is higher on offshore islands due to fewer predators and less disturbance compared to mainland sites.\n\nThe eggs have an average length of about 65 mm (2.6 in), ranging from 45 to 73 mm (1.8 to 2.9 in), and a breadth of 41 mm (1.6 in), ranging from 34 to 45 cm (13 to 18 in).\n\nLongevity and Mortality:\nAfrican oystercatchers typically have a lifespan of around 35 years, during which they are known to pair up for up to 25 years. While adults are rarely predated, disturbances by people, off-road vehicles, dog attacks, and predation by the kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) and other avian predators contribute to most mainland egg and chick fatalities.

Characterized by a large, sharp-edged bill with nostril tubes along the sides, albatrosses use these tubes to measure airspeed accurately during flight, crucial for dynamic soaring. Their feet lack a hind toe, and the anterior toes are fully webbed, enabling them to walk well on land.\n\nTo excrete salts ingested from seawater and marine invertebrates, albatrosses possess an enlarged nasal gland, acting as a salt gland. This gland releases a saline solution through the nostrils or forceful ejection, effectively eliminating excess salt. Albatrosses rely on their highly developed sense of smell to locate food sources, distinguishing them from most birds that rely on eyesight.\n\nAdult plumage varies, with dark upper-wings and back contrasting with white undersides. The southern royal albatross, for instance, is predominantly white in fully mature males. Wingspans of great albatrosses, the largest genus, exceed 3.40 meters, boasting stiff and cambered wings with streamlined leading edges. Albatrosses employ dynamic and slope soaring techniques, utilizing wind gradients and rising air on the windward side of waves to cover vast distances without flapping extensively.\n\nThe efficiency of albatrosses in flight is underscored by their ability to maintain heart rates close to resting levels, and they follow predictable routes based on weather systems. While the assumption is that albatrosses sleep in flight, direct evidence is lacking. Their adaptation to gliding flight, reliance on wind and waves, and efficient foraging strategies contribute to their success as long-distance travelers. The inspiration drawn from albatross flight patterns has implications for aircraft design, particularly in the development of drones and unmanned aircraft.","bird_distr":"Albatrosses are predominantly found in the Southern Hemisphere, ranging from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa, and South America. The only exceptions are the four North Pacific albatross species, with three exclusive to the North Pacific region and one, the waved albatross, breeding in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and feeding off the coast of South America. The geographical distribution of albatrosses is influenced by their dependence on wind for gliding, making them more suited to higher latitudes and challenging the crossing of the doldrums.\n\nThe waved albatross stands as an exception, residing in equatorial waters around the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands due to the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and associated winds. The reasons for the extinction of albatrosses in the North Atlantic remain uncertain, but rising sea levels during an interglacial warming period are speculated to have submerged a short-tailed albatross colony in Bermuda. Occasionally, southern albatross species appear as vagrants in the North Atlantic, and some individuals become exiles, remaining there for extended periods, seeking mates.\n\nSatellite tracking has provided valuable insights into albatross behavior, revealing their ocean-ranging patterns to find food. Albatrosses do not undergo annual migrations but disperse widely after breeding. Southern Hemisphere species often embark on circumpolar trips. Researchers have observed distinct foraging niches among related species, such as the Campbell albatross and the grey-headed albatross. Wandering albatrosses exhibit a preference for waters deeper than 1000 meters, following bathymetric contours closely. Additionally, evidence indicates separate ranges for males and females of the same species, highlighting the complexity of albatross behaviors and movements across the ocean.","bird_eco":"Albatrosses exhibit a diverse diet primarily consisting of cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal, with variations among species and populations. Squid, krill, and fish are common food sources, and some albatrosses scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. During the breeding season, albatrosses return to land, providing an opportunity for comprehensive diet study. Data loggers reveal that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day, with some species, like the wandering albatross, scavenging dead squid that may originate from squid fisheries or the aftermath of squid spawning and whale vomit.\n\nThe foraging behavior of albatrosses includes surface feeding, diving, and plunge diving. Capillary depth recorders indicate varying diving depths among species, with some diving as deep as 12.5 meters. Albatrosses are colonial birds, nesting on isolated islands with varied colony densities. They display strong philopatry, returning to their natal colonies for breeding. The albatross lifespan is remarkable, with most species surviving upwards of 50 years. The delay in reaching sexual maturity, coupled with a prolonged investment in fewer offspring, contributes to their longevity. The oldest recorded albatross, Wisdom, hatched in 1956, making her at least 70 years old.\n\nAlbatrosses reach sexual maturity around five years, and breeding typically commences after several more years, with some species delaying breeding for up to 10 years. Young nonbreeders spend years practicing elaborate breeding rituals and dances, demonstrating synchronized performances involving preening, calling, bill clacking, and more. Albatrosses undertake these rituals to ensure appropriate partner selection and perfect partner recognition.\n\nAlbatrosses lay a single subelliptical egg during the breeding season. Incubation, lasting around 70 to 80 days, is a joint effort by both parents, with the longest incubation period among birds. After hatching, the semi-altricial chick is brooded and guarded for three weeks, fed small meals by both parents. Following this period, the chick is fed at regular intervals with meals comprising fresh squid, fish, krill, and stomach oil. Albatross chicks take an extended time to fledge, with great albatrosses taking up to 280 days. Hybridization is rare among albatrosses due to limited breeding-site vagrancy.","bird_img":["albatross.jpg"],"bird_scale":6}

Despite its smaller size, it possesses a proportionally longer tail and shorter wings compared to its relative. Both sexes share an identical appearance, with the male being marginally larger on average. The juvenile displays a duller appearance than the adult, featuring a dull yellow bill and brownish legs. Distinguished by its characteristics, the Alpine chough is unlikely to be confused with other species in its range, such as the jackdaw and red-billed chough. The jackdaw is smaller with unglossed grey plumage, while the red-billed chough has a distinctive long red bill.\n\nThe subspecies P. g. digitatus, on average, is slightly larger than the nominate form, weighing 191\u2013244 g (6.7\u20138.6 oz) compared to 188\u2013252 g (6.6\u20138.9 oz) for P. g. graculus. P. g. digitatus also possesses stronger feet, aligning with Bergmann's rule, which predicts larger birds in higher elevations or colder and more arid regions. This is complemented by Allen's rule, where body extremities, such as the bill and tarsus, are longer in warmer areas. Temperature appears to be a significant factor influencing body variation in the Alpine chough.\n\nThe Alpine chough's flight is characterized by swiftness and acrobatics, featuring loose deep wing beats. Its high maneuverability involves fanning the tail, folding wings, and soaring in updraughts at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings and longer, less square-ended tail.\n\nThe Alpine chough emits distinctive calls, including the rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo, differing from the more crow-like chee-ow vocalizations of the jackdaw and red-billed chough. It also produces a rolling churr alarm call and various quiet warbles and squeaks when at rest or feeding. A study on chough calls across the Palearctic region revealed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency in Alpine chough calls, with higher-pitched calls in smaller-bodied populations.","bird_distr":"The Alpine chough is a resident breeder in mountainous regions, extending from Spain across southern Europe, the Alps, Central Asia, the Himalayas, to western China. Additional populations are found in Morocco, Corsica, and Crete. Despite being non-migratory, some Moroccan individuals have established a small colony near M\u00e1laga in southern Spain, and occasional wanderers have been recorded in locations like Czechoslovakia, Gibraltar, Hungary, and Cyprus.\n\nThis high-altitude species typically breeds at elevations ranging from 1,260 to 2,880 meters (4,130 to 9,450 feet) in Europe, 2,880 to 3,900 meters (9,450 to 12,800 feet) in Morocco, and 3,500 to 5,000 meters (11,500 to 16,400 feet) in the Himalayas.

Notably, its bill is distinctive, being black, pointed, and elegantly curved upwards towards the tip, surpassing twice the length of its small, rounded head. Sporting long, slender legs and slightly webbed feet, the avocet's legs are characterized by a pastel grey-blue hue, earning it the colloquial name \"blue shanks.\" The plumage showcases a contrasting black and white pattern on the back, with a white underbelly.\n\nDuring the breeding season, the avocet undergoes a captivating transformation, with brassy orange plumage adorning the head and neck, extending somewhat down to the breast. Post-breeding, these vibrant feathers are shed, giving way to a more subdued palette of white and grey. Preening of feathers is a common behavior, considered a comfort movement for the avocet.\n\nThe avocet's call is a distinctive feature, described as a shrill and melodic alarm bweet, rising in inflection over time. The bird employs three distinct calls: the common call, characterized by a loud repeated wheep; the excited call, which speeds up the wheep sound; and the broken wing call, a distressed screech conveying alarm rather than melody.","bird_distr":"The distribution of American avocets once spanned across most of the United States until they were extirpated from the East Coast. These elegant birds favor a breeding habitat comprising marshes, beaches, prairie ponds, and shallow lakes in the mid-west, extending as far north as southern Canada. Their breeding grounds encompass areas to the east of the Rocky Mountains, including parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Utah, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, and reaching down to sections of New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.\n\nDuring migration, American avocets traverse almost every state in the western United States, forming flocks ranging from 50 to 300 individuals as they journey to their breeding sites, typically peaking in the spring. Their wintering grounds are primarily coastal, with locations along the Atlantic Ocean, including North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Additionally, they can be found wintering along the Gulf of Mexico in Florida, Texas, and Mexico, as well as along the Pacific Ocean in California and Mexico. Resident populations of American avocets also exist in the Mexican states of Zacatecas, San Luis Potos\u00ed, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Mexico City, and Puebla, along with Central California.","bird_eco":"**Breeding:**\n\nThe American avocet is a versatile breeder, inhabiting a range of wetlands from freshwater to hypersaline environments in the western and mid-west United States. Upon reaching their breeding grounds, avocets promptly establish territories in pairs. Copulatory displays, initiated by either sex and often involving preening, characterize their breeding season. After breeding, these birds gather in sizable flocks, sometimes numbering in the hundreds. Nesting typically occurs near water, often alongside black-necked stilts, on small islands, or mucky shorelines. Avocets construct their nests on the ground in areas with minimal surrounding vegetation, creating shallow indentations lined with grass, feathers, pebbles, or other small objects. Some avocets opt not to line their nests at all. During the breeding season, avocets lay around 3\u20135 eggs, with 4 being the most common number. Studies suggest that this number optimizes hatching success. Incubation takes place over 23\u201325 days, with both parents taking turns during the day, while only the female incubates the eggs at night. Both parents care for the newborn avocets after hatching. Male parents are more involved in incubation during the first 8 days, while female parents dominate the process for the remaining 16 days. The young are expected to start flying 4 to 5 weeks after hatching.\n\n**Anti-predator behavior:**\nEach pair vigorously defends its territory against predators and other avocets. Nests are strategically built in areas challenging for predators to access. When predators approach, adult avocets distract them by running around. While incubating, defense is a lower priority, unless the eggs are in immediate danger, prompting more aggressive measures.\n\n**Food and feeding:**\nThe American avocet prefers habitats with fine sediments for foraging. In winter, it extensively feeds on brine shrimp, pecking while walking or wading on the shore. During the breeding season, avocets switch to consuming brine flies, abundant in their breeding grounds. The visual feeding methods include pecking at flies, plunging, snatching, and bill pursuit. Tactile feeding involves filtering, scraping, and scythe feeding.","bird_img":["americanavocet.jpg"],"bird_scale":4}

Juveniles bear a resemblance to adults but have less olive coloring on the sides of their necks.description","bird_distr":"The American bittern inhabits a vast expanse of North America. Its breeding grounds extend into southern Canada, reaching as far north as British Columbia, the Great Slave Lake, and Hudson Bay. In the United States, it breeds extensively and possibly ventures into central Mexico. During the fall, this migratory bird embarks on a southward journey, seeking refuge in the southern regions of the United States, particularly along the Gulf Coast. Notable wintering locations include the marshy Everglades of Florida, the Caribbean Islands, and Mexico, with occasional records from Panama and Costa Rica. As a long-distance migrant, the American bittern is an infrequent visitor to Europe, including Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nPreferring aquatic environments, this bird frequents bogs, marshes, and densely vegetated areas bordering shallow-water lakes and ponds, encompassing both fresh and brackish or saline water. At times, it ventures into open spaces like wet meadows and pastures for feeding activities.","bird_eco":"The American bittern is a solitary and elusive bird, often concealed in its surroundings, making observation challenging. Typically, it engages in stealthy movements through shallow water and vegetation, stalking its prey. When detected, it adopts a motionless stance, with its bill pointed upward, leveraging its cryptic coloration to blend into the foliage. Primarily nocturnal, the bittern is most active during dusk. Although elusive visually, the male bittern is recognized by its distinctive, booming call, described as \"oong, kach, oonk.\" During this vocalization, the bird throws its head upward and forward, repeating the sound up to seven times.\n\nThe mechanism behind the bittern's unique call involves inflating its esophagus with air, accompanied by a subtle clicking or hiccuping sound. Flaps beside the tongue help maintain esophagus inflation, culminating in the distinctive gulping sound produced in the syrinx. After completing the call, the bird deflates its esophagus.\n\nSimilar to other heron family members, the American bittern forages in marshes and shallow ponds, primarily preying on fish but also consuming amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, crustaceans, and insects. Exhibiting territorial behavior, it displays a threat posture by slowly erecting concealed white plumes on its shoulders, resembling wing-like extensions across its back. This display serves as a warning to intruders, with the bird adopting a threatening stance or stalking in a crouched position.\n\nNesting solitarily in marshes amid coarse vegetation, such as bulrushes and cattails, the female builds the nest while the male stands guard. Positioned about 15 cm above the water, the nest comprises a rough platform of dead stalks and rushes, occasionally incorporating twigs, and is lined with coarse grass. The female incubates up to six eggs for twenty-nine days. The eggs, bluntly ovoid and olive-buff, measure around 49 by 37 mm. Chicks are fed individually, pulling down the female's beak to receive regurgitated food. They leave the nest at about two weeks and achieve full fledging at six to seven weeks.","bird_img":["botauruslentiginosus.jpg"],"bird_scale":5}

Adult coots exhibit a distinctive appearance characterized by a short, robust, white bill and a frontal shield, typically white and often featuring a reddish-brown spot near the top of the bill, positioned between the eyes. Both males and females share a similar appearance, although females are generally smaller in size. The body mass of females ranges from 427 to 628 g (0.941 to 1.385 lb), while males exhibit a weight range of 576 to 848 g (1.270 to 1.870 lb). Juvenile coots display olive-brown crowns and a gray body, transitioning to adult coloring around 4 months of age.\n\nThe American coot is easily identified by its white frontal shield, which exhibits a red spot connecting the eyes. The size of the frontal shield varies depending on the season and mating status of the bird. Winter birds tend to have smaller, 'shrunken' shields, while those in the breeding season are noted to have swelled shields. Permanently paired or mated birds typically have larger shields.\n\nIn a 1949 report by Gordon W. Gullion, it was noted that the reddish-brown spot on the frontal shield is referred to as the callus. Despite its proximity to the shield, it is not considered a part of the frontal shield as it does not completely cover the maxilla (jawbone) of the coot. Additionally, it differs in both color and texture from the shield.\n\nThe American coot communicates through a variety of repeated calls and sounds. Male and female coots produce different types of calls in response to similar situations. Male alarm calls are described as \"puhlk,\" while female alarm calls are characterized as \"poonk.\" Stressed males may emit sounds like \"puhk-cowah\" or \"pow-ur,\" while females produce a call described as \"cooah.\"","bird_distr":"American coots are typically found in the vicinity of water bodies such as reed-ringed lakes, ponds, open marshes, and sluggish rivers. While they primarily prefer freshwater environments, they may temporarily inhabit saltwater areas during the winter months.\n\nThe breeding habitat of the American coot spans from marshes in southern Quebec to the Pacific coast of North America, extending as far south as northern South America. Birds from temperate North America, east of the Rocky Mountains, migrate to the southern United States and southern British Columbia. In regions where water remains open in winter, these birds can be year-round residents. There is an observed increase in the number of birds staying year-round near the northern limit of the species' range.\n\nAutumn migration occurs from August to December, with males and non-breeders moving south before females and juveniles. Spring migration to breeding ranges takes place from late February to mid-May, with males and older birds leading the northward movement. Some evidence suggests that coots can travel as far north as Greenland and Iceland during migration.\n\nCoots residing in the Caribbean, Greater Antilles, and Lesser Antilles were once thought to be a distinct species called the Caribbean coot (Fulica caribaea) due to the absence of the red portion in the frontal shield. However, recent research revealed that this characteristic was not exclusive to Caribbean coots, as some American coots in certain locations also exhibited fully white shields. In 2016, the American Ornithological Society consolidated the Caribbean coot as a regional variation of the American coot, as there was no reliable way to distinguish the two species, and there was no evidence of distinct mating behaviors between them.","bird_eco":"The American coot is a highly social species, particularly during winter when its flocks can swell to thousands. These flocks display interesting collective formations while swimming, including single-file lines, synchronized swimming, rotational dynamics, broad arcing formations, and sequential take-off dynamics.\n\nFeeding habits involve a diverse range of activities. The American coot can dive for food, forage, and scavenge on land. While aquatic vegetation, especially algae, forms a significant part of their diet, they are omnivorous, consuming arthropods, fish, and other aquatic animals. During the breeding season, their diet often includes aquatic insects and mollusks, particularly crucial for chick development.\n\nThe mating season for American coots occurs in May and June, and they form monogamous pairings throughout their lives if they secure a suitable territory. The reproductive cycle involves pairing, nesting, copulation, egg deposition, incubation, and hatching. Courtship includes behaviors like billing, bowing, and nibbling, with males primarily initiating billing. Once a pair bond is established, they seek a territory for nesting. The copulation process is brief, lasting no more than two seconds.\n\nThe American coot is a prolific nest builder, creating various structures during a single breeding season. These structures include display platforms, egg nests, and brood nests. The nests are constructed in well-concealed locations in tall reeds. Females typically lay one egg per day until the clutch is complete, usually deposited between sunset and midnight. They are persistent re-nesters, replacing lost clutches within two days of clutch loss during deposition.\n\nIncubation is a shared responsibility, with males playing a more active role during the 21-day incubation period. Hatch order follows the same sequence as laying order, with a typical maximum brood size of eight chicks. Egg desertion is common among coots due to constraints on food resources or stimulation for incubation. Maternal effects, including hormone variations, influence offspring growth and behavior.\n\nConspecific brood parasitism is a common reproductive strategy, with up to 40% of nests being parasitized. American coots can recognize and reject parasitic chicks, demonstrating parental selection. The chicks themselves exhibit ornamental traits known as \"chick ornaments,\" brightly colored plumes that increase the likelihood of being favored by parents. The American coot displays aggression in defense of its eggs, reducing losses to predators.\n\nPredators of American coots include various bird species like crows, magpies, owls, eagles, and gulls, as well as mammalian predators such as foxes, coyotes, skunks, raccoons, and muskrats. While their protected nesting habitat helps reduce egg and young losses, coots are susceptible to predation once out of the breeding season due to their bold behavior.","bird_img":["americancoot.jpg"],"bird_scale":4}

It lays a solitary chalky-white egg on a mud mound, a process occurring between May and August. The incubation period spans 28 to 32 days, during which both parents diligently brood their young. While sexual maturity can be attained between 3 and 6 years, reproduction typically begins at the age of 6. Notably, these elegant birds boast a remarkable life expectancy of up to 40 years, ranking among the longest in the avian world.\n\nAdult American flamingos, although smaller than their greater counterparts, stand as the largest flamingo species in the Americas. Their stature ranges from 120 to 145 cm (47 to 57 in). Males weigh an average of 2.8 kg (6.2 lb), while females tip the scales at around 2.2 kg (4.9 lb). The predominant pink plumage, distinguishing them from the paler greater flamingo, is complemented by red wing coverts and black primary and secondary flight feathers. The bill exhibits a pink and white coloration with a prominent black tip, while the legs display an entirely pink hue. The vocalization of the American flamingo resembles a goose-like honking sound. Additionally, this species falls under the purview of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds.","bird_distr":"The American flamingo, recognized for its vibrant reddish-pink plumage, has a breeding range encompassing South America, the West Indies, and tropical to subtropical regions of continental North America. In South America, it breeds in locations such as the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, coastal Colombia, Venezuela, and northern Brazil. The West Indies also host breeding populations on islands like Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, The Bahamas, and others. In continental North America, their habitat spans from the northern coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico to the southern tip of Florida (historically) and even reaching as far as northern South America. Vagrant occurrences have been noted in Puerto Rico, Anguilla, Barbados, Honduras, and Florida, with some Florida populations currently considered year-round residents. Notably, the Gal\u00e1pagos population exhibits genetic distinctions, presenting smaller size, sexual dimorphism in body shape, and smaller eggs, sometimes classified as Phoenicopterus ruber glyphorhynchus.\n\nThe preferred habitats of the American flamingo align with those of its relatives, including saline lagoons, mudflats, and shallow, brackish coastal or inland lakes. An example of its habitat is the Petenes mangroves ecoregion in the Yucat\u00e1n.\n\nIn the context of Florida, the American flamingo has become an iconic symbol, widely associated with the state. While the species was historically present in the region until the early 20th century, the strong connection between flamingos and Florida can be traced back to the Flamingo Hotel in Miami Beach during the 1920s. Despite the decline in native populations in Florida, sightings and associations persisted, often fueled by escapees from captivity. However, a 2018 study confirmed the native status of flamingos in Florida, leading to calls for federal protection as a threatened species. This recognition was based on historic observations by early naturalists, breeding records, and modern resident populations, exemplified by individuals like Conchy, an abandoned young flamingo found in Key West. Recent events, such as the influx of flamingos brought by Hurricane Idalia in 2023, further highlight the dynamic nature of flamingo populations in the region, with the potential for recolonization from recovering Caribbean populations.","bird_eco":"The mating and bonding behaviors of American flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber) have been extensively observed, particularly in captivity. Typically monogamous during the selection of a nest site and the incubation and raising of young, these birds also exhibit frequent extra-pair copulations.\n\nIn the courtship process, males generally take the initiative, but females exert control over the proceedings. Mutual interest is signaled when a female walks by a male, and if the male is receptive, he accompanies her. Synchronized movements occur, progressing until one member terminates the process. Low-intensity courtships involve both birds walking in unison with raised heads, while high-intensity courtships feature a quick-paced walk with heads dropped in a false feeding posture. This intense courtship ceases if specific cues, such as a turn without the other following, raised heads, halted unison movements, or slowed pace, are observed. If the female is receptive to copulation, she stops walking and presents herself to the male. Long-term pairs engage less frequently in courtship behaviors, often standing, sleeping, and eating in close proximity.\n\nCourtship is more commonly observed in individuals with changing partners or those exhibiting promiscuous behavior. Pairing relationships vary, with some birds maintaining long-term partnerships throughout the year, while others form pairs during courtship and nest attendance periods. The duration of a relationship is influenced by factors such as the addition or removal of adults, the maturation of juveniles, and the occurrence of trios and quartets.\n\nIn nesting trios, dynamics differ based on the composition. Trios with one male and two females may involve conflicts between the females, while in trios with two males and one female, the subordinate male often assumes the role of primary incubator and caregiver. Quartets, comprising one dominant male and two females, display less animosity between the females compared to trios. Nesting duties are usually shared among both individuals in a pair, although some rare cases involve a single individual undertaking both roles. Incubation and caregiving are shared equally between alternating parents, with nest reliefs occurring predominantly in late afternoon or early morning. The attentive periods during incubation and brooding last 21\u201360 hours, with parents either remaining in the same lagoon to feed or flying to other lagoons when food is scarce. After chicks leave the nest, feeds are primarily nocturnal, and the time for receiving food decreases as the chicks mature. Both male and female partners exhibit similar frequencies and durations of feeding.","bird_img":["americanflamingo.jpg"],"bird_scale":6}

Key measurements include a wing chord ranging from 6.5 to 7.8 cm (2.6 to 3.1 in), a tail length of 4.2 to 5.1 cm (1.7 to 2.0 in), a culmen of 0.9 to 1.1 cm (0.35 to 0.43 in), and a tarsus measuring 1.2 to 1.4 cm (0.47 to 0.55 in). The beak is small, conical, and pink for most of the year, transitioning to a vibrant orange during the spring molt in both sexes. This specialized beak aids in extracting seeds from the seed heads of thistles, sunflowers, and other plants.\n\nThe American goldfinch undergoes molting twice a year, a unique feature among cardueline finches. During the winter molt, it sheds all its feathers, and in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which exhibit distinct coloration. The sexual dimorphism in plumage coloration becomes particularly evident after the spring molt when the male's bright lemon-yellow summer plumage, complemented by a black cap and white rump, serves to attract a mate. Following the autumn molt, the vibrant summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage, featuring buff tones below and olive-brown shades above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The autumn plumage is nearly identical in both sexes, but the male retains yellow shoulder patches.\n\nThe immature bird displays a dull brown back, while the underside exhibits a pale yellow hue. The shoulders and tail are dull black with buff-colored markings on the wings and rump. This coloration remains consistent between both sexes.\n\nThe American goldfinch's song is a delightful series of musical warbles and twitters, often with a prolonged note. In flight, it emits a distinct tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call, which can also be described as per-chic-o-ree. During nesting, the female produces a soft continuous tee-tee-tee-tee-tee sound as she incubates the eggs. The young adopt a chick-kee or chick-wee call shortly before fledging, continuing to use it until leaving the nest entirely. Adult goldfinches employ two defense calls during nesting: a sweet call to rally other goldfinches and distract predators, and a bearbee used to signal nestlings to quiet down and crouch in the nest for decreased visibility.","bird_distr":"The American goldfinch (Spinus tristis) exhibits a preference for open landscapes abundant with thriving weeds, including fields, meadows, floodplains, as well as roadsides, orchards, and gardens. This habitat choice remains consistent during its spring and autumn migrations.\n\nDuring the summer breeding season, the American goldfinch spans its range across North America from coast to coast. The northern boundary extends to Saskatchewan, while the southern range includes North Carolina on the east coast and northern California on the west coast. Notably, the American goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, responding to colder temperatures and reduced food availability by moving south. Ornithologist Marc Parnell suggests that this migratory pattern typically initiates as daily low temperatures approach freezing, especially when nearing 0 \u00b0F. The migration occurs in compact flocks, characterized by an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.\n\nIn winter, the American goldfinch's range encompasses southern Canada, extending southward through the United States into parts of Mexico. In the northern regions of its winter range, these finches may move closer to feeders if available, while in southern areas, they continue to inhabit fields and floodplains similar to their summer dwellings.\n\nHistorical attempts to introduce the American goldfinch into Bermuda in the 19th century and Tahiti in 1938 were unsuccessful, as the species failed to establish a sustainable population in either location.","bird_eco":"The American goldfinch, scientifically known as Spinus tristis, exhibits a distinctive undulating flight pattern, characterized by a rhythmic sequence of wing beats, wing folding, and gliding. Accompanying this flight are vocalizations such as \"per-twee-twee-twee\" or \"ti-di-di-di,\" interspersed with silent periods during coasting.\n\nCommunication among American goldfinches involves a repertoire of vocalizations, including a distinctive call resembling \"po-ta-to-chip.\" When faced with potential threats in their territory, these birds employ alarm calls but refrain from aggressive behaviors. Predators that pose a risk include snakes, weasels, squirrels, blue jays, hawks, and cats. Social dynamics within the species vary between nonbreeding and breeding seasons.\n\nDuring the nonbreeding season, American goldfinches are gregarious, forming large flocks, often in conjunction with other finches. Social hierarchy tends to favor males as dominant during this period. In contrast, the breeding season sees the establishment of loose colonies marked by territorial aggression during nest construction, where female dominance becomes apparent. Displays such as head-up, carpals-raised, and head-forward signal varying levels of intensity in these interactions.\n\nBreeding activities commence later in the year compared to other finches and native North American birds. Courtship rituals involve aerial displays and singing, with males showcasing their quality and fitness. Nest construction, primarily orchestrated by the female in late summer, results in an intricately woven structure made from bark, weeds, vines, and grass, typically situated in deciduous shrubs or trees. The clutch comprises four to six bluish-white eggs, exclusively incubated by the female.\n\nChicks hatch after 12\u201314 days of incubation, displaying altricial characteristics. The mother feeds them regurgitated seeds and insects, facilitating rapid development towards independence. Although the American goldfinch occasionally faces brood parasitism, particularly from brown-headed cowbirds, it proves to be a poor host with low hatching rates and fledging success.\n\nAs a diurnal feeder, the American goldfinch primarily adheres to herbivorous dietary preferences, consuming seeds from various plants. Occasional inclusion of insects, especially when feeding the young, showcases their adaptability. The use of their feet extensively, including hanging from seedheads, demonstrates a level of dexterity that enhances survival chances, providing access to food sources that may be challenging for potential competitors to reach.","bird_img":["americangoldfinch.jpg"],"bird_scale":1}

Females are generally larger, weighing about 10% to 15% more than males within a subspecies, with northern subspecies tending to be larger.\n\nPhysically, American kestrels have a leaner and less muscular build compared to larger falcons. Their pectoral flight muscles make up about 12% of their body weight, adapted for energy-conserving ambush hunting rather than prolonged aerial pursuits. Despite their less muscular physique, they possess strong talons and beaks, enabling swift dispatch of prey. This energy-efficient strategy allows for a lower daily food intake while maintaining the ability to capture prey as large as themselves.\n\nIn terms of plumage, males have blue-grey wings with black spots, white undersides with black barring, rufous back, and white or rufous-tipped tail with a black subterminal band. Females display rufous wings with dark brown barring, creamy to buff undersides with heavy brown streaking, and a rufous tail with numerous narrow dark black bars. Both sexes have a white head with a bluish-grey top, two narrow vertical black facial markings on each side, and two black spots (ocelli) on the white or orangish nape, serving as potential deterrents to attackers.\n\nThe American kestrel's vocalizations include the \"klee\" or \"killy,\" delivered in a rapid series when upset or excited, with larger females typically having lower-pitched voices than males. The \"whine\" call is associated with feeding and copulation, while the \"chitter\" is used during interactions between male and female birds, including courtship feeding, copulation, and the feeding of nestlings. Nestlings can produce calls similar to adults at 16 days old.","bird_distr":"The American kestrel (Falco sparverius), commonly known as the sparrow hawk, stands as the smallest and most prevalent falcon in North America. Demonstrating a size range roughly two-to-one across subspecies and sexes, it varies from the weight of a blue jay to that of a mourning dove. With a well-established presence, this species has evolved into 17 subspecies adapted to diverse environments throughout the Americas, showcasing sexual dimorphism in size and plumage.\n\nIts vibrant and attractive plumage, characterized by a rufous back with noticeable barring, remains consistent between juveniles and adults. The American kestrel is adept at energy-conserving hunting, employing perching and ground scanning or aerial hunting, occasionally hovering with rapid wing beats. Its diverse diet, encompassing grasshoppers, insects, lizards, mice, and small birds like sparrows, contributes to its widespread success as a species. Nesting occurs in various cavities, including trees, cliffs, buildings, and structures, with both sexes assisting in incubating three to seven eggs.\n\nThe breeding range spans from Alaska, through Canada, to Nova Scotia, extending southward throughout North America, into central Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and widely across South America. Birds breeding in Canada and northern regions often migrate south during winter. Occasional vagrancy to Western Europe has been noted.\n\nDespite being considered a member of the European and African kestrel clade based on appearance and behavior, genetic analysis reveals the American kestrel's closer relation to larger American falcons like the peregrine, aplomado, and prairie falcons. While not renamed after these genetic findings, it is not a kestrel in the phylogenetic sense but has developed similar physical characteristics and hunting methods due to convergent evolution, adapting to a comparable small prey niche in the ecosystem.\n\nFrequently employed in falconry, especially by beginners, the American kestrel, though not as formidable a flyer as larger falcons, can become an effective hunter under proper training and weight control. Capable of targeting birds within the size range of sparrows and starlings, it occasionally achieves success against birds up to approximately twice its own weight.","bird_eco":"The American kestrel, acknowledged as the smallest raptor in America under traditional classification, displays sexual dimorphism with some plumage color overlap between males and females.

Their habitat requirements include perches, open spaces for hunting, and nesting cavities, either natural or man-made. Remarkably adaptable, they can thrive from the Arctic Circle to the tropics and elevations exceeding 4,500 m in the Andes Mountains. Their distribution spans from northern Canada and Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, representing the sole kestrel species in the Americas.\n\nMigration patterns vary, with northern populations migrating south in winter, converging with smaller resident kestrels in Mexico. Birds breeding below approximately 35\u00b0 north latitude are usually year-round residents. The species exhibits sexual maturity by their first spring, with males arriving first at breeding grounds. Pair bonds are strong and often permanent, with pairs reusing previous nesting sites. Females display promiscuity for one to two weeks upon arrival, stimulating ovulation.\n\nCavity nesters, American kestrels adapt to various nesting situations, preferring natural cavities or utilizing abandoned nests of other birds. They commonly lay three to seven eggs, approximately 24\u201372 hours apart. Incubation, mainly the female's responsibility, lasts about 30 days, with hatchlings being altricial. Young kestrels fledge after 28\u201331 days, and the species has a life expectancy of three to five years in the wild. In ecological terms, the reproductive pattern leans towards an \"r-selection\" strategy, emphasizing a high growth rate and larger broods.

Initially documented by Marmaduke Tunstall in 1771 in his Ornithologia Britannica, it was formerly categorized as a variant of the water pipit. In North America, it is referred to as the \"American pipit,\" while in Eurasia, it goes by the name \"buff-bellied pipit.\"\n\nIn terms of appearance, the buff-bellied pipit shares the typical unassuming look of most pipit species, often observed running on the ground. The rubescens subspecies, known as the American pipit, displays lightly streaked grey-brown upperparts and diffuse streaking on the buff breast and flanks. Its whitish belly contrasts with the dark bill and legs. On the other hand, the japonicus subspecies, or Japanese pipit, presents a darker upper body with bold black streaking on whiter underparts, accompanied by legs with a reddish tint. The characteristic call of this species is a squeaky sip.\n\nKey measurements for the buff-bellied pipit include a length of 16 cm, a weight of 22 g, and a wingspan of 24 cm.","bird_distr":"The buff-bellied pipit, scientifically known as Anthus rubescens, comprises four recognized subspecies categorized into two main groups. Notably, morphological distinctions and variations in DNA sequences among these subspecies are quite evident, prompting consideration as potentially distinct species, pending further research:\n\n1. A. r. rubescens - (Tunstall, 1771), American pipit \u2013 breeds in northern Canada east to Greenland and northeast United States, wintering in Central America.\n2. A. r. pacificus - (Todd, 1935) Breeds in Pacific Cordillera from Alaska to Oregon, wintering in western Mexico. Some birds breeding in south Alaska have been proposed as a distinct subspecies, A. r. geophilus.\n3. A. r. alticola - (Todd, 1935) Breeds in the Rocky Mountains from southern British Columbia to California, wintering in Mexico.\n4. A. r. japonicus - Temminck & Schlegel, 1847, Japanese pipit or Siberian pipit \u2013 breeds in most of the eastern Palearctic, including Japan.\n\nGenetically, this species shares a close relationship with the European rock pipit (A. petrosus) and water pipit (A. spinoletta). Formerly considered conspecific, they can be differentiated by vocalizations and certain visual cues. It's worth noting that rock and buff-bellied pipits are not found sympatrically, except as vagrant individuals. Additionally, the ranges of buff-bellied and water pipits overlap only in a limited area in Central Asia.","bird_eco":"Both subspecies of the buff-bellied pipit are known for their migratory behavior. During winter, the buff-bellied pipit can be found along the Pacific coast of North America and on the Atlantic coast, ranging from southern North America to Central America. Notably, the wintering range of the buff-bellied pipit has seemingly expanded northwards in the 20th century. In the modern context, these birds spend less time in winter quarters, exemplified by their presence in northern Ohio. In the 1900s, they were considered \"not common\" during migration in May and September\/October. However, in contemporary times, the species is regarded as a \"widespread migrant\" in the region, being observed between March and May and from late September to November. Many birds even winter in this northern area. Asian birds typically winter from Pakistan to Southeast Asia, with some occasional individuals found as far north as Yunnan. Certain populations in Japan are either year-round residents or engage in minimal migration. Both the American and Asian subspecies are rare vagrants to Western and Eastern Europe.\n\nAs insectivores, buff-bellied pipits share dietary preferences with their relatives. During the breeding season, these birds inhabit tundra environments. However, outside the breeding season, they are commonly found in open, lightly vegetated areas, akin to the favored habitats of the water pipit (A. spinoletta).\n\nUpon arriving at the breeding site during snowmelt, buff-bellied pipits initiate the crucial process of pairing. Male individuals engage in one-on-one combat to secure a mate for the entire breeding season. These skirmishes also determine access to favorable, snow-free nesting sites, as the melting snow leads to an abundance of arthropods, the primary food source for these birds. Following successful pairing and territorial negotiations, the nesting phase commences.\n\nNests are typically situated on the ground in dry or wet meadows, strategically avoiding shrubs or trees. The construction of the ideal nest depends on the materials available in the vicinity, commonly composed of sedge, fine grass, and occasionally horse hairs, all providing protective elements. Nest success poses a significant challenge, with numerous predators like ants and hawks targeting the vulnerable nests.\n\nIf the nesting stage proves successful, the female lays eggs, typically within a period of 4 to 5 days after snowmelt (occurring in April\u2013May) until mid-July. The clutch size generally consists of 5 eggs, subject to variations influenced by snowfall, parental reproductive ability, and predation.\n\nEggs undergo an incubation period of 13\u201314 days. Throughout this time, the female remains dedicated to the nest, displaying heightened reactivity to surrounding movements. Communication with the male occurs through singing, as he brings food and defends their territory. Approximately four or five days post-hatching, the fledgling appears thin, sporting a blue-gray hue and possessing only its secondary feathers. The female diligently broods the clutch for a week, after which both parents contribute to feeding.\n\nAfter the initial 7 days, the fledglings are ready for independent flight, yet parental feeding continues for an additional 14 days post-departure. Eventually, immature birds form small flocks with their counterparts and embark on their independent journeys.","bird_img":["americanpipit.jpg"],"bird_scale":2}

Notably, its length is accentuated by a relatively elongated tail, contributing to its classification as one of the lighter birds within its family. Weight differentials are significant between seasons, with males weighing around 8.6 g (0.30 oz) in summer and decreasing to 7.2 g (0.25 oz) in winter. Females exhibit an even more pronounced decrease, reducing from an average of 8.7 g (0.31 oz) to 6.9 g (0.24 oz) in winter.\n\nStandard measurements include a wing chord spanning 5.5 to 6.9 cm (2.2 to 2.7 in), a tail length of 4.9 to 5.8 cm (1.9 to 2.3 in), a bill measuring 0.7 to 0.9 cm (0.28 to 0.35 in), and a tarsus ranging from 1.5 to 1.9 cm (0.59 to 0.75 in). Breeding males showcase an unmistakable appearance, with jet-black upperparts adorned with large orange-red patches on wings and tails. Their breast sides also feature a vibrant orange hue, contrasting with the remaining white underparts. In non-breeding plumages, American redstarts exhibit green upperparts, black central tails, and grey heads. The orange patches seen in breeding males are substituted with yellow in females and young birds. This coloration results from carotenoids, with males possessing red carotenoid canthaxanthin and yellow carotenoids canary xanthophyll A and B, creating an orange hue. Females exclusively possess the yellow carotenoids. Recent research indicates age and sex effects on observed color attributes, except for saturation, which only shows an age effect. Their melodic song comprises a series of musical \"see\" notes, while their call is a soft chip.","bird_distr":"While perhaps not as prevalent as in the past, the redstart stands out as one of the most resilient and abundant New World warbler species. Despite being surpassed in overall numbers by common yellowthroats, yellow warblers, and yellow-rumped warblers, its stability and abundance are noteworthy. The expansive natural breeding ranges of the mentioned species contribute to their higher total numbers, with potential higher density within suitable habitats.\n\nThe redstart's breeding grounds span North America, encompassing southern Canada and the eastern United States. This species follows a migratory pattern, wintering in Central America, the West Indies, and northern South America. Occasional rare vagrants may be observed in western Europe. During the breeding season, redstarts prefer open-canopy environments, including deciduous forests, second-growth areas, and forest edges. With insectivorous tendencies, they often share foraging habitats with other warblers, focusing on the mid to lower regions of trees or shrubs. Migration sees them occupying a diverse range of habitats, including various shrubby areas.\n\nOn wintering grounds in Central and South America, redstarts adapt to nearly all woody habitats, displaying a preference for non-forested agricultural areas. Shade-grown coffee plantations are a common habitat, offering native trees and shrubs alongside coffee trees. Elevations vary by location, with redstarts found at heights up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) in South America and up to 1,500 m (4,900 ft) in Jamaica.","bird_eco":"**Breeding:**\nRedstarts choose breeding habitats in open woodlands or scrub, frequently in proximity to water sources. Their nests, typically situated in the lower sections of bushes, hold 2\u20135 eggs within a meticulously crafted cup-shaped structure. The female diligently incubates the clutch for 10 to 13 days. After spending 9 days in the nest, the young birds fledge and may remain under the care of one parent for up to 3 weeks. First-year males, while capable of reproduction during their initial breeding season, retain a plumage resembling females, potentially leading to lower reproductive success (less than 50% of first-year males) until their second year. In contrast, the majority of first-year females successfully reproduce in their inaugural breeding season. A skewed sex ratio has been observed, resulting in an excess of unmated males.\n\nAmerican redstarts exhibit a mixed mating strategy, predominantly favoring monogamy. However, approximately 25% of males maintain multiple territories and engage in polygyny. Even within monogamous pairs, a notable proportion of offspring, up to 40%, are not sired by the male partner. The vibrancy of the male's coloration, attributed to carotenoid pigments, influences their success in holding territory during non-breeding seasons in the Caribbean, the likelihood of polygyny, and the proportion of offspring within their nests that they father. Males are highly territorial, with superior individuals occupying prime habitats like moist mangroves, while less dominant males settle for secondary habitats such as dry scrub forests.\n\n**Feeding:**\nRedstarts are nearly exclusive insectivores, relying heavily on flycatching to capture their prey. Additionally, they have been observed gleaning insects from leaves. Displaying remarkable activity, they often fan out their tails while actively flashing the orange and yellow hues to startle and pursue insects within the underbrush. This species demonstrates adaptability in feeding, adjusting to varying habitats, seasons, insect communities, vegetation structures, and times of the day. Their diet primarily comprises caterpillars, moths, flies, leafhoppers, planthoppers, small wasps, beetles, aphids, stoneflies, and spiders. Although berries and seeds are consumed infrequently, when they are, they are often sourced from barberry, serviceberry, and magnolia.","bird_img":["americanredstart.jpg"],"bird_scale":1}

Typically weighing around 77 g (2.7 oz), males range from 72 to 94 g (2.5 to 3.3 oz), while females range from 59 to 91 g (2.1 to 3.2 oz). Standard measurements include a wing chord of 11.5 to 14.5 cm (4.5 to 5.7 in), a culmen of 1.8 to 2.2 cm (0.71 to 0.87 in), and a tarsus of 2.9 to 3.3 cm (1.1 to 1.3 in). The head exhibits variations from jet black to gray, adorned with white eye arcs and supercilia. A white throat with black streaks, complemented by a white belly and undertail coverts, contrasts with a brown back and a reddish-orange breast, ranging from rich red maroon to peachy orange. The bill, predominantly yellow with a variably dark tip, shows an extended dusky area in winter, while the legs and feet take on a brown hue.\n\nBoth sexes share similarities, but females tend to display a duller coloration compared to males, featuring a brownish tint to the head, brown upperparts, and less vivid underparts. Some birds, however, cannot be reliably sexed based solely on plumage. Juveniles exhibit paler colors than adult males, showcasing dark spots on their breasts and whitish wing coverts. While first-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, they often appear duller, and a small percentage may retain a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.","bird_distr":"The American robin, a widespread species, breeds across most of North America, extending from Alaska and Canada to northern Florida and Mexico. While some individuals occasionally overwinter in the northern U.S. and southern Canada, the majority undertake migratory journeys, wintering south of Canada from Florida and the Gulf Coast to central Mexico, as well as along the Pacific Coast. Migration patterns vary, with robins departing south by the end of August and returning north in February and March, the distances traveled influenced by their initial habitat. Remarkably, robins tagged in Alaska were found to travel up to 3.5 times farther across seasons than those tagged in Massachusetts.\n\nThis species is a rare vagrant to western Europe, particularly Great Britain, with occasional sightings in Greenland, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Belize. The American robin's breeding habitat encompasses woodlands, open farmland, and urban areas. While less common as a breeder in the southernmost part of the Deep South, it prefers large shade trees on lawns in that region. The winter habitat is similar but includes more open areas.\n\nNotably, the American robin serves as a known reservoir for West Nile virus, transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. While crows and jays are typically the first casualties in areas with West Nile virus, the American robin plays a crucial role as a host, surviving the virus longer and spreading it to more mosquitoes. This, in turn, increases the risk of transmission to humans and other species. Researchers have developed a successful West Nile virus vaccine administered to American robins, resulting in a significant decrease in the viral load. While an intramuscular injection has shown effectiveness, further research is needed for the development of an oral bait, which could be a more practical and cost-effective method of vaccine distribution.","bird_eco":"The American robin is diurnal, primarily active during the day, while assembling in large nocturnal flocks on its winter grounds to roost in trees within secluded swamps or dense vegetation. During winter, these flocks disperse during the day to feed on fruits and berries, exhibiting more social behavior. In contrast, during the summer breeding season, the American robin becomes territorial and less social.\n\nTheir diet comprises approximately 40% small invertebrates, mainly insects such as earthworms, beetle grubs, caterpillars, and grasshoppers, and 60% wild and cultivated fruits and berries. This flexible diet allows them to winter in more northern regions than many other North American thrushes. The American robin has been observed consuming fermented Pyracantha berries, displaying signs of intoxication. It forages primarily on the ground for soft-bodied invertebrates, using visual and auditory cues, and is known for its distinctive running and stopping behavior.\n\nVarious threats exist for the American robin, with juvenile robins and eggs being preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, birds, and mammals. Raptorial birds pose a significant predatory impact, with 28 species known to hunt American robins. The species is also a rejecter of cowbird eggs, minimizing brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds. In terms of disease, the American robin is a reservoir for West Nile virus, spreading it to mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans.\n\nBreeding typically occurs shortly after the American robin returns to its summer range. It is among the first North American bird species to lay eggs, often having two to three broods per breeding season from April to July. The nest, constructed by the female, is commonly located in dense bushes or tree branches, approximately 1.5\u20134.5 meters above the ground. A clutch consists of three to five cyan eggs, incubated by the female alone for 14 days, with chicks leaving the nest approximately two weeks later. Chicks are fed a diet of earthworms, insects, and berries.\n\nThe American robin's vocalization is notable, featuring a complex and almost continuous song described as a cheery carol, composed of discrete units often repeated and spliced together. The song varies regionally and temporally, with males singing from late February or early March to late July or early August. Additionally, they vocalize specific calls to communicate information, such as the presence of ground predators or threats to nests or other robins. The species is often among the first songbirds to sing at dawn and continues into the evening, singing from high perches in trees.","bird_img":["americanrobin.jpg"],"bird_scale":3}

It also breeds in the Boreal Forest and subarctic river deltas of Canada and Alaska. While present in all flyways, the Pacific Flyway hosts the largest population, with key wintering areas including the Central Valley of California and Washington's Puget Sound. Other significant wintering locations are the Texas Panhandle, the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas, the Caribbean, and parts of Central America and northwestern South America.\n\nBeing a migratory species, the American wigeon winters farther south than its breeding range, extending to the southern half of the United States, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and the Mid-Atlantic coastal region. Additionally, it winters in Central America, the Caribbean, and northwestern South America. The American wigeon is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe, particularly noted in Great Britain and Ireland since at least 1958.\n\nThe 2009 survey estimated approximately 2.5 million breeding wigeons in the traditional survey area, slightly below the 1955\u20132009 average. Recent trends indicate a decline in wigeon numbers in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada and an increase in the interior and west coast of Alaska. Despite fluctuations, the American wigeon consistently ranks as the fifth-most commonly harvested duck in the United States, following the mallard, green-winged teal, gadwall, and wood duck.","bird_eco":"The American wigeon is predominantly found in open wetlands, including wet grasslands and marshes with some taller vegetation. Its feeding habits primarily involve dabbling for plant food or grazing, both in water and on dry land. While on water, these wigeons often congregate with coots and divers, and are known for opportunistic feeding, sometimes grabbing pieces of vegetation brought to the surface by diving water birds, earning them the monikers \"poacher\" or \"robber\" ducks. Their diet consists mainly of plant matter, including waste grain in harvested fields, winter wheat, clover, lettuce, and other vegetation. Given their predominantly herbivorous diet, most American wigeons migrate in the fall before northern marshes freeze.\n\nOutside the breeding season, the American wigeon exhibits highly gregarious behavior, forming large flocks.\n\nBreeding typically commences in April-May. The nest is a depression on dry ground, often at a distance from water sources, and is concealed in vegetation. Lined with grass and down, the nest serves as the incubation site for a clutch of 7\u20139 cream-colored eggs, each measuring approximately 52.9 mm \u00d7 37.5 mm (2.08 in \u00d7 1.48 in) and weighing around 43 g (1.5 oz). The incubation period lasts for 23\u201325 days and is undertaken solely by the female. The male often deserts the female before the incubation period concludes.

On average, these birds weigh around 1.22 kg (2.7 lb), with a range of 1.04\u20131.35 kg (2.3\u20133.0 lb). Their bill is relatively long, about twice the length of the head, sharply pointed, and yellow, complemented by yellow webbed feet.\n\nThe male anhinga boasts a glossy black-green plumage with a glossy black-blue on the wings, base of wings, and tail. The tip of the tail is white, and the back of the head and neck feature elongated feathers described as gray or light purple-white. The upper back of the body and wings are spotted or streaked with white.\n\nThe female anhinga closely resembles the male but has a pale gray-buff or light brown head, neck, and upper chest. The lower chest or breast takes on a chestnut color, and the back is browner than the male's.\n\nHatchlings begin bald but quickly develop tan down within a few days. This tan down is eventually replaced by white down within two weeks. Three weeks after hatching, the first juvenile feathers emerge. Juveniles exhibit mostly brown plumage until they reach breeding age, typically after the second or third winter.\n\nAlthough often confused with the double-crested cormorant due to their similar size and shape, the anhinga can be distinguished by its longer and wider tail and pointed bill, as opposed to the cormorant's hooked bill.","bird_distr":"Anhinga species inhabit warm shallow waters globally. The American anhinga is divided into two subspecies: A. a. anhinga, primarily found east of the Andes in South America, including the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, and A. a. leucogaster, located in the southern United States, Mexico, Cuba, and Grenada. A fossil species, Anhinga walterbolesi, has been identified from the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene period in Australia.\n\nMigration patterns in anhingas are influenced by temperature and sunlight availability. Birds residing in the extreme north and south of their range may migrate towards the equator during winter, with the migration extent determined by the sunlight needed to warm the birds. Although not within their usual range, anhingas have been observed as far north as the states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and New York in the United States.\n\nKettles of anhingas often migrate alongside other birds, creating a spectacle likened to black paper gliders.","bird_eco":"Anhingas exhibit unique behaviors related to their aquatic lifestyle. They swim using webbed feet, hunting underwater by spearing prey with their long necks. Anhingas lack waterproof feathers, causing them to become soaked upon entering the water. Despite this, their dense bones and wet plumage enable them to submerge fully and search for prey beneath the surface. Unlike birds with waterproof feathers, such as ducks and pelicans, anhingas cannot stay afloat for extended periods.\n\nAnhingas face challenges when flying with wet wings and often run on the water for short distances to take off. To dry their feathers and absorb heat, they adopt a distinctive posture with wings spread and feathers fanned open, resembling a semicircular shape facing away from the sun. This behavior, known as the drying position, also contributes to their colloquial names 'water turkey' or 'swamp turkey,' owing to their resemblance to a male turkey.\n\nIn terms of diet, anhingas consume moderately sized wetland fishes, amphibians, aquatic invertebrates, and insects. Their feeding strategy involves stalking fish underwater, locating prey, and swiftly stabbing it with their bills. Larger fish may be subdued through repeated stabs, and once captured, anhingas bring their prey to the water's surface, toss it backward, and engulf it head-first. The diet of anhingas can include a variety of aquatic organisms, such as fishes, crayfish, crabs, shrimp, aquatic insects, tadpoles, water snakes, and small terrapins. The specific prey items can vary depending on the region, with different types of fish being prominent in their diet in various locations.","bird_img":["anhinga.jpg"],"bird_scale":6}

They exhibit an iridescent bronze-green back, a pale grey chest and belly, and green flanks. The adult male boasts a vivid crimson-red crown and gorget, which appears magenta-derived, and a dark, slightly forked tail. In contrast, females also possess iridescent red gorgets, typically smaller and less brilliant than their male counterparts.\n\nThe male Anna's hummingbird is distinct among North American hummingbirds for having a red crown, while females and juvenile males feature a dull green crown, a grey throat with or without some red iridescence, a grey chest and belly, and a dark, rounded tail with white tips on the outer feathers.\n\nThe male's striking reddish-pink crown and gorget are strongly iridescent, with the intensity varying based on the angle of illumination and observation. This iridescence is a result of large stacks of melanosomes in the feather barbules, reflecting light like partially-opened Venetian blinds. This feature enhances courtship attraction and territory defense. Male birds with a higher protein intake in their diet exhibit more colorful crowns and increased iridescence in their head feathers compared to those with lower protein intake.\n\nThe male Anna's hummingbird produces a scratchy and metallic call, often heard while perched in trees and shrubs. These hummingbirds have adapted to urban environments and are frequently observed in backyards, parks, and around feeders and flowering plants, where they consume flying insects.","bird_distr":"Anna's hummingbirds are native to the western coast of North America, ranging from southern Canada to northern Baja California. They also inhabit inland areas extending to southern and central Arizona, extreme southern Nevada and southeastern Utah, and western Texas. While primarily permanent residents within their range, Anna's hummingbirds have been spotted far outside their typical territories in locations such as southern Alaska, Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Louisiana, and Newfoundland.\n\nThese hummingbirds have demonstrated adaptability to changing conditions, including the expansion of their range into cooler high-altitude environments, such as the Sierra Nevada in California, in response to rising temperatures at lower elevations during climate change in the 21st century.\n\nNotably, Anna's hummingbirds hold the northernmost year-round range among all hummingbirds. They have been observed in Alaska since 1971 and have become residents in the Pacific Northwest since the 1960s. Scientists suggest that some individuals overwinter and potentially breed at northern latitudes where food and shelter are available throughout the winter, with the birds tolerating moderately cold temperatures.\n\nThe expansion of their range northward is attributed to factors like the widespread planting of non-native species, such as eucalyptus, and the use of urban bird feeders. The species has shown a propensity for extensive postbreeding dispersal. The Pacific Northwest, in particular, has witnessed the fastest-growing populations, with the expansion associated with introduced plants, year-round nectar availability from human-supplied feeders, milder winter temperatures, and the species' acclimation to cooler winter climates.\n\nIn colder temperatures at mountainous elevations, Anna's hummingbirds utilize torpor\u2014a state of lowered metabolic rate\u2014to survive periods of subfreezing weather, especially when lacking sufficient body fat stores or insufficient plumage for insulation. The frequency of torpor use is higher at higher elevations compared to lower elevations.","bird_eco":"Anna's hummingbirds play a crucial role in pollination as they collect nectar from flowers. There is evidence suggesting that these hummingbirds generate an electrostatic charge while in flight, which adheres pollen to their beaks and feathers. This facilitates the transfer of pollen grains to numerous flowers as they forage for nectar, contributing significantly to plant pollination. Additionally, Anna's hummingbirds have been observed consuming tree sap.\n\nTheir remarkable ability to shake their bodies at an incredible speed\u201455 times per second\u2014serves various purposes. It helps shed rain while in flight, and in dry weather, it aids in removing pollen or dirt from their feathers. Each twist lasts a mere four-hundredths of a second and applies a force equivalent to 34 times the force of gravity on the bird's head.\n\nDuring hovering flight, Anna's hummingbirds maintain high wingbeat frequencies, achieved through their large pectoral muscles and the recruitment of motor units. Their pectoral muscles are composed exclusively of fast glycolytic fibers that respond rapidly and are fatigue-resistant.\n\nIn terms of courtship behavior, unlike most northern temperate hummingbirds, male Anna's hummingbirds sing. Their song is characterized by thin and squeaky sounds interspersed with buzzes and chirps, lasting over 10 seconds. During the breeding season, males perform an aerial display dive over their territories, reaching impressive speeds and producing audible sounds with their tail feathers.\n\nBreeding habitats for Anna's hummingbirds include open-wooded or shrubby areas and mountain meadows along the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Arizona. The female is responsible for raising the young without assistance from the male. Nests, typically built in shrubs or trees, vines, or attached to artificial substrates, are constructed with plant fibers, downy feathers, animal hair, and bound together with spider silk. The exterior is often camouflaged with lichen, plant debris, and occasionally urban detritus.\n\nAnna's hummingbirds may engage in hybridization with other species, particularly the Costa's hummingbird. Natural hybrids, mistaken for new species in the past, have been identified, such as those between Anna's hummingbird and Allen's hummingbird or black-chinned hummingbird. This highlights the dynamic interactions and adaptations within the hummingbird species.","bird_img":["annashummingbird.jpg"],"bird_scale":1}

Categorized broadly, \"antshrikes\" are characterized by their larger size, \"antvireos\" are of medium size and robust build, while \"antwrens\" encompass the smaller species. Within the antbird family, genera can exhibit significant variations in size. These birds feature short, rounded wings, facilitating adept maneuverability in dense undergrowth. Notably, obligate ant-followers possess large and robust legs, adapted for gripping vertical stems and saplings prevalent in undergrowth. The claws of these species are longer than those of non-ant-followers, with some having tough projections on the soles for enhanced grip. Tarsus length in antbirds correlates with foraging strategy, with perch-gleaning species having longer tarsi compared to those catching prey on the wing.\n\nMost antbirds display proportionately large and sturdy bills. Certain antshrike genera exhibit a strongly hooked tip to the bill, while all antbirds possess a notch or 'tooth' at the bill's tip, aiding in grasping and crushing insect prey. Plumage among antbirds is generally soft and subdued in color, with occasional striking patterns. Blackish, whitish, rufous, chestnut, and brown hues dominate the color palette, either in uniform tones or patterned with barring or spots. Sexual dimorphism is common, with males typically sporting combinations of grey, black, or white plumage, while females exhibit buff, rufous, and brown colors. Interscapular patches of contrasting white feathers are present in many species, often concealed but visible when raised during excitement or alarm.\n\nAntbird songs and calls consist of repeated, simple notes, distinctive and species-specific, aiding in field identification by ear. The family belongs to suboscines, possessing simpler syrinxes than other songbirds. Despite their less complex vocal apparatus, antbirds' songs are unique and identifiable. Communication is crucial in their dark forest habitats, with most species featuring at least two types of calls \u2013 loudsong and softsong. Loudsongs are often territorial, used during encounters at territory edges or morning rounds. Softsongs are more intricate, potentially linked to pair-bond maintenance. Beyond these primary calls, antbirds produce various sounds, including scolding during predator mobbing. Additionally, interspecifically, some species actively seek ant-swarms using the calls of ant-followers as cues.","bird_distr":"Antbirds exclusively inhabit the Neotropics, predominantly thriving in tropical regions. The majority of species prefer humid lowland rainforests, with only a few extending their range from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. Notably, species like the barred antshrike exhibit a continental distribution that spans most of South and Middle America, while others, such as the ash-throated antwren, have more restricted distributions.\n\nThese birds are primarily associated with lowland rainforests, and only a minority venture into higher elevations. Less than 10% of antbird species have ranges exceeding 2000 m (6500 ft), with almost none reaching above 3000 m (10000 ft). The Amazon basin boasts the highest species diversity, with up to 45 species documented in single locations across Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. As one moves away from the core of the family's distribution, the number of species sharply declines. For instance, Mexico hosts only seven antbird species. Nevertheless, regions with lower thamnophilid diversity may harbor localized endemics. The Yapacana antbird, confined to nutrient-poor white-sand soil areas known as the Amazonian caatinga, exemplifies such cases in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. Some species exhibit preferences for specific microhabitats within larger ecosystems; for instance, the bamboo antshrike predominantly occupies bamboo patches.\n\nComparative genetic analyses of whole genomes between higher and lower-humidity antbirds have revealed differences in genes associated with water balance and temperature regulation. Notably, these avian species differ not only in the genes themselves but also in the regions of the genome regulating gene activity. This suggests that the distinctions among antbirds are more a result of how genes are deployed rather than the genes per se.","bird_eco":"Antbirds, diurnal in nature, engage in activities such as feeding, breeding, and territorial defense during daylight hours. Although they prefer shaded areas, they occasionally partake in anting, where ants or arthropods are rubbed on their feathers, possibly as a means to handle distasteful substances in prey items.\n\nDiet-wise, these birds predominantly consume arthropods, including insects like grasshoppers, crickets, cockroaches, and butterflies' larvae. They also feed on spiders, scorpions, and centipedes. Some larger species may include frogs and lizards in their diet. Antbirds employ various foraging techniques, with most being arboreal and utilizing distinct strategies like perch-gleaning or sallying to catch prey.\n\nMany antbirds participate in mixed-species feeding flocks, where they form cohesive groups to enhance predation awareness. Additionally, some species have evolved to follow swarms of army ants, utilizing them as a critical resource. While some antbirds opportunistically feed at army ant swarms, 18 species are obligate ant-followers, obtaining most of their diet from such swarms.\n\nAntbirds are monogamous, forming pair bonds that typically last a lifetime. Their breeding territories vary in size, and nests, constructed by both parents, are cups made of vegetation. Clutch sizes usually consist of two eggs, with both parents participating in incubation and chick-rearing activities.\n\nIn terms of ecology, antbirds play crucial roles in ecological processes but face threats from predators and habitat fragmentation. The relationship between obligate ant-followers and army ants was once thought to be mutualistic, but experiments suggest a parasitic nature, impacting the foraging success of the ants. The complex interactions extend to other species, including butterflies that feed on antbird droppings, highlighting the interconnectedness in rainforest ecosystems.","bird_img":["antbird.jpeg"],"bird_scale":2}

During the breeding process, the female lays a clutch of 1-4 eggs, and the incubation period lasts for approximately 13 days. An intriguing aspect of their reproductive behavior is that, while incubating, the male does not visit the nest but instead feeds the female when she is away. The female, although not vocalizing from the nest, locates her singing male and actively begs for food. Once the eggs hatch, both parents contribute to feeding the nestlings. The period of dependency for young \u02bbApapane is less than four months.","bird_img":["apapane.jpg"],"bird_scale":2}

Once the eggs hatch, the entire group is involved in feeding the chicks and maintaining the nest's cleanliness.\n\nThe social structure of apostlebirds follows a fission-fusion pattern. During winter, these birds gather in larger flocks. As the breeding season approaches, these winter groups break into smaller breeding groups. This change in group size results from the merging of breeding groups in winter and their subsequent separation in the summer breeding season. Breeding groups establish small, non-overlapping home ranges around the nest site, while winter ranges are more extensive, allowing groups to freely interact with one another.\n\nThe breeding season for apostlebirds spans from August to December. Their nest is a deep cup-shaped structure crafted from grasses held together with mud or occasionally manure, positioned in a tree fork at heights reaching seven or eight meters above the ground. The clutch consists of three to five pale blue-white eggs, sparsely splotched with brown and lavender shades, measuring 22 mm x 29 mm and possessing a tapered oval shape.","bird_img":["apostlebird.jpg"],"bird_scale":3}

Resembling the helmeted manakin, this species is relatively large and possesses a long tail, measuring approximately 14.5 centimeters (5.7 inches) in total length. The visually striking males exhibit predominantly white plumage, with the wings, except for the small white coverts, being black, as is the tail. A carmine red patch extends from the frontal tuft, across the crown, down to the middle of the back. The males' iris is red, adding to their vibrant appearance. In contrast, females showcase mainly olive green plumage with pale green upperparts and a reduced olive green frontal tuft.","bird_distr":"This species is restricted to the Chapada do Araripe (Araripe uplands) in the Brazilian state of Cear\u00e1, situated in the northeastern region of the country. The habitat is characterized by the Santana Formation limestone, and the endemic range spans only fifty kilometers in length and one kilometer in width. The distinct habitat is primarily shaped by the soils derived from the Santana Formation limestone. The pure breeding range covers a mere 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi) and is located within a theme park. While the species may be more widespread than currently documented, surveys in the nearby Balneario das Caldas have not yielded any recorded individuals.\n\nThreats to the Araripe manakin were evident in the year 2000 when the estimated population was less than 50 individuals, marking it as one of the rarest birds not just in Brazil but globally. Initial findings in 2000 identified only three males and one female. In 2003, more optimistic estimates suggested a population range between 49 to 250 individuals. By 2004, the assumption was that fewer than 250 individuals existed in the wild, based on the discovery of 43 males. A significant threat occurred in 2000 when a theme park with swimming pools and asphalted roads was constructed at the type locality Nascente do Farias, leading to the destruction of a substantial portion of its original habitat. The cleared areas were replaced with banana plantations. As of August 7, 2018, the last assessed population estimated that 150 to 700 mature individuals inhabit Brazil.\n\nNotably, Sir David Attenborough announced his support for the conservation of the Araripe manakin during the BirdLife International celebrity lecture in Peterborough on August 16, 2008. This effort aimed to raise funds for the protection of this rare bird, emphasizing the urgency of its conservation. With approximately 500 pairs of the Araripe manakin remaining, Sir David received a picture of the manakin following his lecture, which focused on Alfred Russel Wallace and Birds of Paradise.","bird_eco":"The Araripe manakin exhibits a diet that encompasses both plant and animal materials. A significant portion, approximately 80%, of their dietary intake is derived from the plant Clidemia biserrata. Their diet consists of fruits and arthropods, with fruits being the predominant component. Females display a more diverse diet compared to males, attributed to the cryptic olive-green plumage of females that provides enhanced camouflage in forest environments. This camouflage allows females to forage with reduced predation risk. In contrast, males, with their bright white coloration, are more vulnerable to predation. Additionally, females possess longer bills, enabling them to manipulate a wider variety of fruit types compared to males, who may have limitations in handling and digesting certain fruits. This dietary adaptation reflects the species' ecological strategies and the distinct roles of males and females in foraging behavior.","bird_img":["araripemanakin.jpg"],"bird_scale":2}

Its colonies for breeding are established on islands situated along the coasts of California and Mexico. As one of six storm petrel species thriving in the abundant California Current system, this avian species plays a role in the intricate marine ecosystem.\n\nCharacterized by a compact size and a consistently sooty-brown plumage, the ashy storm petrel displays a distinctive forked tail. While resembling the black storm petrel, it distinguishes itself by its smaller size and a fluttering flight style. During flight, its upstroke uniquely transitions horizontally to the body before initiating the downstroke, setting it apart from other storm petrels in its geographic range.","bird_distr":"The ashy storm petrel is a breeding resident on 17 islands in the northeast Pacific, primarily along the California coast, including sites off northwestern Mexico. The Farallon Islands near San Francisco host half of the global population, with other breeding locations encompassing the eight Channel Islands of California and a small contingent on Mexico's Coronados. Notably, Bat Cave on Santa Cruz Island boasts the world's largest nesting colony for this species, accommodating over 100 nests.\n\nOutside the breeding season, these seabirds are believed to have a more expansive distribution, foraging along the California Current. However, they do not undertake extensive migrations and don't venture as far as some other storm petrel species. During the early fall, sizable flocks can be observed in Monterey Bay. Their inland range is limited, except for instances of being blown inland by storms.\n\nThe global population is estimated at around 10,000 birds, with 8,000 being breeders. The Farallon population experienced a one-third decline between 1972 and 1992, warranting conservation concern in California. Threats to the ashy storm petrel include predation by western gulls and burrowing owls, artificial light from fishing vessels, introduced predators like rats and feral cats, and pollution. While many breeding islands receive varying degrees of protection, the species faces potential challenges due to climate change. Global warming may alter coastal California waters, leading to reduced food availability for the petrels. Additionally, ocean acidification could impact prey species, and rising sea levels may jeopardize nesting sites close to water. These factors collectively underscore the need for conservation efforts to safeguard the ashy storm petrel's future.","bird_eco":"The ashy storm petrel exhibits a social nature while at sea, engaging in nocturnal feeding on cephalopods, fish, and krill, particularly the deep-sea myctophids and Thysanoessa spinifera. This seabird also frequents fishing vessels, drawn by the fish oils released during net retrieval.\n\nFor nesting, ashy storm petrels choose rock burrows on offshore islands, returning to these nests under the cover of night. The breeding cycle is protracted, with egg laying occurring in May and fledging taking place in October. Notably, the timing of breeding activities varies widely among individuals, with some pairs having half-grown chicks while others are still in the egg-laying phase. The species displays both mate and site fidelity, with pairs consistently reuniting and nesting in the same burrow over several years. Despite spending the non-breeding season apart, these birds maintain a remarkable loyalty to their chosen mates and nesting sites. A change in mate typically coincides with a shift in nesting location.\n\nDemonstrating longevity, the ashy storm petrel can live for an extended period, with recorded instances of individuals surviving for at least 31 years, showcasing the resilience and adaptability of this remarkable seabird.","bird_img":["ashystormpetrel.jpg"],"bird_scale":3}

The wings maintain a green hue, and the beak is black. It's worth noting that juveniles lack the elongated tail feathers, and both sexes share a similar appearance.\n\nThe distinctive call of this bird is a nasal trill, reminiscent of \"tree-tree-tree-tree,\" often emitted during flight. Notably, instances of leucistic individuals, characterized by their partial loss of pigmentation, have been documented.","bird_distr":"This bird is abundant and exhibits a relatively docile nature, making it a familiar presence across its extensive habitat. Typically breeding in open areas adorned with bushes, it thrives in arid regions in Africa and Arabia but displays a broader habitat diversity towards the east. An interesting trait is its inclination to hunt from low perches, often only a meter or less in height. The species readily utilizes fence wires and electric wires for this purpose. Unlike some of its counterparts among bee-eaters, this bird is not restricted to areas near water sources.\n\nWhile commonly observed in plains, it can also be spotted at elevations of up to 5,000 or 6,000 feet (1,500 or 1,800 m) in the Himalayas. Its residency is established in the lowlands of South Asia, but certain populations exhibit seasonal movements, although specific patterns remain unclear. These movements involve shifts to drier regions during the rainy season and relocation to warmer areas in winter. Notably, in certain parts of Pakistan, they are recognized as summer visitors.","bird_eco":"Bee-eaters, including this species, primarily feed on insects such as bees, wasps, and ants. They adeptly catch their prey in mid-air during sorties from open perches. Before consuming their catch, bee-eaters meticulously remove stings and break the prey's exoskeleton by thrashing it repeatedly on their perch. While migration isn't documented, they exhibit seasonal movements corresponding to rainfall patterns.\n\nThese birds tend to be somewhat sluggish in the mornings, often gathering on wires with bills tucked in their backs well after sunrise. They engage in sand-bathing more frequently than other bee-eater species and occasionally bathe in water by dipping during flight. Typically observed in small groups, they communally roost in substantial numbers (200\u2013300). During roosting, the birds display animated movements and emit loud calls, occasionally dispersing explosively before settling back into the roost tree.\n\nNotably, the little green bee-eater is increasingly prevalent in urban and suburban areas. They've been observed perching on television antennae, launching into brief zig-zag flight formations to catch insects, and returning to the same perch for consumption.

Its glossy black wings and tail, with a green or purple sheen, add a striking contrast. Adult birds are characterized by a distinct gap formed between the recurved lower and arched upper mandible of the beak, contributing to the origin of their name. This unique feature is absent in young birds. The mandible's cutting edges possess a fine brush-like structure believed to enhance their grip on snail shells.\n\nThe mantle is black, and the bill takes on a horn-grey color. At a distance, the Asian openbill stork may resemble a white stork or Oriental stork. Pinkish to grey legs, turning reddish prior to breeding, support their relatively short stature. Non-breeding individuals exhibit smoky grey wings and back instead of white. Young birds, on the other hand, have a brownish-grey appearance with a brownish mantle.\n\nAs a broad-winged soaring bird, akin to other storks, the Asian openbill relies on moving between thermals of hot air for sustained flight. Often found in flocks, though single birds are not uncommon, they fly with their neck outstretched. Despite being smaller than typical storks, the Asian openbill stands at a height of 68 cm (81 cm long).","bird_distr":"The Asian openbill stork primarily engages in foraging within inland wetlands, with infrequent sightings along river banks and tidal flats. In agricultural landscapes, these birds can be observed foraging in crop fields, irrigation canals, and seasonal marshes. Their foraging habits are adaptable, and they may traverse considerable distances in response to changing habitat conditions. Young birds, after fledging, disperse widely, as evidenced by recoveries of individuals ringed in Bharatpur, India, at locations 800 km to the east and a bird ringed in Thailand found 1500 km to the west in Bangladesh.\n\nNotably, storks are occasionally disoriented by lighthouses along the southeast coast of India during overcast nights between August and September. The species exhibits rarity in the Sind and Punjab regions of Pakistan but is widespread and common in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia. Furthermore, there has been recent expansion into southwestern China, showcasing the adaptability and evolving range of this species.","bird_eco":"During the warmer hours of the day, Asian openbill storks soar on thermals, exhibiting a notable behavior of descending rapidly into their feeding areas. Groups often forage closely together in shallow waters or marshy grounds, where they walk with a slow and steady gait. Their primary diet consists of large mollusks, particularly Pila species. To extract the snail from its shell, the storks use the tip of their beak, with the lower mandible often twisted to the right. The process involves inserting the tip into the snail's opening and extracting the body while keeping the bill submerged. The bill gap, which forms only with age, is not directly involved in handling snail shells. Recent studies propose that the rough edge of the bill serves as an adaptation to handle hard and slippery shells.\n\nThese storks employ a unique foraging technique, holding their bill tips slightly apart and making rapid vertical jabs in shallow water, often partially submerging their head and neck. The bill gap, when present, allows the tips to strike at a greater angle, increasing the force applied to snail shells. Smaller snails may be swallowed whole or crushed. Additionally, Asian openbill storks feed on water snakes, frogs, and large insects. When foraging in varied landscapes, they prefer natural marshes and lakes, especially during the monsoon and winter, and irrigation canals, particularly in the summer.\n\nBreeding for Asian openbill storks typically occurs after the rains, ranging from July to September in northern India and Nepal and from November to March in southern India and Sri Lanka. Breeding may be skipped in drought years. These storks breed colonially, constructing rough stick platforms, often on half-submerged trees such as Barringtonia, Avicennia, and Acacia species. The nesting trees may be shared with egrets, cormorants, and darters or form single-species colonies. Nesting colonies are occasionally found in highly disturbed areas, including inside villages and on trees within crop fields. The nests are close together, leading to aggressive interactions between neighboring birds. Both parents take turns in incubation, with the eggs hatching after about 25 days. The chicks emerge with cream-colored down, shaded by the parent's loosely outspread and drooped wings.\n\nThe initiation of nests in lowland Nepal is synchronized, typically starting in July and August. Breeding success is influenced by the proximity of colonies to human habitation and the timing of the breeding season. Colonies closer to human habitation and those initiated later in the season have lower success rates. Agricultural areas may not always be detrimental to these storks, as observed in colonies in Nepal and a protected mangrove reserve in eastern India. Nesting openbills in Nepal take an average of 27 minutes to return to nests with food for nestlings and fledglings.\n\nCommunication among these storks is limited, with silence being the norm except for clattering produced during copulation, caused by the striking of the male's bill against that of the female. Low honking notes accompany up and down movements of the bill when greeting a partner arriving at the nest. Males may form polygynous associations with two females, occasionally laying their eggs in the same nest.\n\nThese storks face predation risks, with young birds at the nest being preyed upon by imperial, steppe, and greater spotted eagles. Various helminth parasites, such as Chaunocephalus ferox and Echinoparyphium oscitansi, have been documented in Asian openbill populations. Historically, in colonial India, these storks were hunted for meat, earning them the moniker \"beef-steak bird.\"","bird_img":["asianopenbillstroke.jpg"],"bird_scale":6}

Its presence is widespread in significant portions of its range, and it inhabits numerous protected areas. Consequently, the species is assessed as least concern by BirdLife International and the IUCN.\n\nPreviously considered a subspecies of the green figbird and simply referred to as the figbird, a name still prevalent in Australia where the Australasian figbird is the sole figbird species, it was later designated as a distinct species. This separation was primarily based on differences in measurements, plumage, and biogeography. There have been occasional considerations of further splitting the Australasian figbird into two distinct species \u2013 the more northern yellow figbird (S. flaviventris) and the green or southern figbird (S. vieilloti). However, extensive intergradation where they meet suggests they are part of a single biological species.\n\nFive recognized subspecies are:\n\n1.

Yellow figbird (S. v. flaviventris) \u2013 Gould, 1850: Originally described as a separate species. Also named the northern figbird. Found in north-eastern Australia and Torres Strait Islands.\n5. S. v. vieilloti \u2013 Vigors & Horsfield, 1827: Found in eastern Australia.","bird_eco":"True to their name, Australasian figbirds primarily sustain themselves through a frugivorous diet, although they also incorporate small insects, nectar, and small seeds into their feeding habits. While mostly resident, with potential migratory movements in the southern population, their nomadic tendencies are influenced by the availability of food.\n\nIn contrast to most orioles, Australasian figbirds exhibit gregarious behavior, often forming flocks consisting of 20 to 40 individuals during the nonbreeding season. They even engage in breeding within small, loosely organized colonies. The nest, characterized by its flimsy and saucer-shaped structure, is crafted from plant material and typically positioned relatively high in a tree. Both male and female Australasian figbirds participate in incubating the clutch of two to four eggs, which generally hatches after 16\u201317 days. Intriguingly, these birds have been observed nesting in proximity to the assertive spangled drongo and helmeted friarbird, potentially benefitting from their presence as they deter potential nest predators.

The vocalizations of young eagles are often harsher and shriller compared to those of adults.","bird_distr":"The bald eagle boasts a widespread natural range, encompassing the majority of North America, which includes most parts of Canada, the entire continental United States, and northern Mexico. Remarkably, it stands as the sole sea eagle exclusive to North America. This majestic bird adapts to diverse habitats, from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the deciduous forests of Quebec and New England. Northern bald eagles exhibit migratory behavior, while their southern counterparts are resident, maintaining their breeding territories year-round. In the 1950s, during a period of minimal population, the species was mainly confined to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. However, from 1966 to 2015, bald eagle numbers experienced a substantial surge across their winter and breeding ranges. By 2018, these iconic birds had established nests in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn Canada, the majority of bald eagles are concentrated along the British Columbia coast, with significant populations also thriving in the forests of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario. During winter, notable congregations occur in specific locations, such as Squamish, British Columbia, where one to two thousand birds gather from November to February. These congregations are drawn to the salmon spawning in the Squamish and Cheakamus Rivers.\n\nDespite being native to North America, the bald eagle has made rare appearances outside its typical range. Notably, it has been documented as a vagrant twice in Ireland, with a juvenile being illegally shot in Fermanagh on January 11, 1973, and another exhausted juvenile captured near Castleisland, County Kerry, on November 15, 1987. Additionally, a record exists of a bald eagle sighting at Llyn Coron, Anglesey, in the United Kingdom, on October 17, 1978, although the origins of this particular individual eagle remain a subject of dispute.","bird_eco":"During its breeding season, the bald eagle establishes its presence in a wide array of American wetland habitats, encompassing seacoasts, rivers, large lakes, marshes, and other bodies of open water rich in fish. Research indicates a preference for water bodies with a circumference exceeding 11 km (7 mi), and lakes with an area greater than 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are deemed optimal for breeding. The bird's affinity for old-growth and mature stands of coniferous or hardwood trees is crucial for perching, roosting, and nesting. The species displays a preference for trees over 20 m (66 ft) tall, with an open structure and good visibility, particularly when situated near prey-rich environments. Nesting trees, whether in mangrove swamps or on dry ground, range from 6 m (20 ft) to 38 m (125 ft) in height, emphasizing the importance of an abundance of relatively large trees surrounding the water body. Nesting trees should have a canopy cover between 20% and 60% and be within 200 m (660 ft) of open water. The largest recorded bald eagle nest, found in Florida in 1963, measured nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep, attesting to the bird's need for substantial nesting spaces.\n\nIn Canada, the British Columbia coast harbors the majority of bald eagles, with substantial populations in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario. Winter congregations occur in Squamish, British Columbia, where eagles gather to feed on salmon during the spawning season. The bald eagle has been observed as a vagrant in Ireland and the United Kingdom, displaying its adaptability to various environments.\n\nWhen nesting, the bald eagle is sensitive to human activity, preferring areas with minimal disturbance. However, it may occasionally nest in large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, showcasing a level of adaptability to human presence. During the winter, the species becomes less habitat-sensitive, congregating in areas with plentiful perches and abundant prey. In non-breeding or wintering periods, eagles may venture into upland, terrestrial habitats, especially in regions where unfrozen water is not easily accessible.\n\nThe bald eagle is a powerful flier, utilizing thermal convection currents to soar and reaching speeds of 56\u201370 km\/h (35\u201343 mph) while gliding and flapping. It exhibits remarkable maneuverability in flight, and its diet is diverse, comprising fish as the primary component. When hunting fish, the eagle swoops down, snatches the fish with its talons, and consumes it by tearing the flesh with the other talon. The species is also known for hunting bird prey in flight, attacking prey as large as Canada geese. Bald eagles can fly with fish equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy, the eagle may be dragged into the water. The bird is capable of swimming and may drag its catch ashore with its talons, although some eagles may drown or succumb to hypothermia.\n\nIn addition to hunting live prey, bald eagles obtain food through carrion, kleptoparasitism (stealing prey from other predators), and scavenging. They are opportunistic carnivores, with a vast range of prey species, making them versatile in their feeding habits. Despite their sometimes negative perception due to scavenging practices, bald eagles play a crucial role in various ecosystems as apex predators.","bird_img":["baldeagle.jpg"],"bird_scale":6}

It boasts a large size, measuring 70\u201380 cm (28\u201331 in) in length, a wingspan ranging from 125 to 135 cm (49\u201353 in), and an average weight of 1.0\u20131.3 kg (35\u201346 oz). Its glossy black plumage exhibits bronze-green and violet iridescence, complemented by a wispy ruff on the hind neck. The face and head, unfeathered and of a dull red hue, create a captivating contrast. Both the long, curved bill and the legs share the same red color.\n\nDuring flight, the northern bald ibis showcases powerful, shallow, and flexible wing beats. Typically silent, it emits guttural hrump and high, hoarse hyoh calls within its breeding colonies. Sexes share similar plumage, with males being generally larger and possessing longer bills, a feature advantageous in mate attraction. The downy chick has uniformly pale brown plumage, and the fledged juvenile resembles the adult but with a dark head, light grey legs, and a pale bill. The unfeathered areas gradually transition to red as the bird matures.\n\nNotably, there are variations in bill length between Moroccan and Turkish populations, with Moroccan birds having a significantly longer bill. The eastern and western populations, if considered separable subspecies, pose challenges in determining the nominate form, as the first description of the species was based on an extinct population from Switzerland, the race of which remains unknown.\n\nDistinguishing features set the northern bald ibis apart from its close relative, the southern bald ibis of Southern Africa. Unlike the southern species with a whitish face, the northern bald ibis exhibits a red, unfeathered face. While overlapping in range with the glossy ibis, another dark-plumaged species, the northern bald ibis is larger and stockier. In flight, differences in wing shape and neck length, as well as the relative position of feet to the tail, help differentiate the northern bald ibis from the glossy ibis.","bird_distr":"The northern bald ibis exhibits unique breeding and foraging behaviors that set it apart from many other ibises. Unlike its counterparts that nest in trees and feed in wetlands, the northern bald ibis chooses undisturbed cliff ledges for breeding and irregularly cultivated, grazed dry areas, such as semi-arid steppes and fallow fields, for foraging. The close proximity of suitable steppe feeding areas to breeding cliffs is crucial for its habitat requirements.\n\nHistorically, the northern bald ibis had a widespread distribution across the Middle East, northern Africa, and southern and central Europe. Fossil remains date back to the Mesolithic and Neolithic Periods, indicating its presence in regions like Solothurn. It bred along prominent rivers and mountains in Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and likely the Upper Adriatic region. However, it vanished from Europe over three centuries ago and is now extinct over most of its former range.\n\nThe remaining wild breeding population, numbering just over 500 birds, is concentrated in Morocco, primarily at Souss-Massa National Park and near the mouth of the Oued Tamri (north of Agadir). Three documented colonies exist in Souss-Massa National Park, while a single colony near Oued Tamri houses almost half of the Moroccan breeding population. Some movement of birds between these two sites has been observed.\n\nIn Turkey, the northern bald ibis had a unique survival story in one colony near Birecik. Religious traditions, considering the ibis as a guide for Hajj pilgrims to Mecca, protected the species. Despite population stability until the mid-20th century, numbers declined significantly by the 1970s. A captive breeding program initiated in 1977 did not reverse the decline, leading to the species becoming extinct in the wild in Turkey by 1992.\n\nAlthough the Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season, there were occasional sightings of the northern bald ibis in the Middle East during the 1980s and 1990s. Surveys in 2002 revealed that the species persisted in the Syrian desert steppes, challenging the belief of its complete extinction in the region. An active breeding colony was found near Palmyra, with seven individuals.\n\nSatellite tagging in 2006 provided insights into the wintering habits of Syrian birds. They wintered together in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. The migration route included travel south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and the return north through Sudan and Eritrea. This discovery shed light on previously unknown aspects of the northern bald ibis's migratory patterns and habitats.","bird_eco":"The breeding behavior of the northern bald ibis is characterized by loosely spaced colonies, with nesting occurring on cliff ledges or among boulders on steep slopes, typically in coastal or riverine locations. Volunteers have created additional ledge spaces in the Souss-Massa colonies to ensure the breeding population is not constrained by the availability of nest ledges. In managed colonies, such as Birecik, artificial nest boxes are employed. Historically, these ibises also nested in buildings.\n\nBreeding typically commences at three to five years of age, and pairs form lifelong bonds. The male selects a nest site, cleans it, and attracts a female through crest waving and low rumbling calls. Once paired, the bond is reinforced through displays and mutual preening. The nest is a loose construction of twigs lined with grass or straw. The northern bald ibis lays two to four rough-surfaced eggs, initially blue-white with brown spots, becoming brown during incubation. The incubation period lasts 24\u201325 days, and the chicks fledge in another 40\u201350 days, with the first flight occurring around two months. Both parents participate in incubation and feeding.\n\nIn captivity, the northern bald ibis has an average lifespan of 20 to 25 years (the oldest recorded male being 37 years and the oldest recorded female being 30 years). In the wild, the average lifespan is estimated at 10 to 15 years.\n\nThis gregarious species commutes in flocks from breeding sites or winter roosts to feeding areas, flying in a V formation, with winter flocks possibly containing up to 100 birds. During the breeding season, they forage up to 15 km from the colony, preferring steppe areas for feeding but also utilizing fallow and cultivated fields.\n\nThe northern bald ibis exhibits a diverse diet, mainly consisting of animal food. Faecal analysis of the Moroccan breeding population indicates a preference for lizards and tenebrionid beetles, with small mammals, ground-nesting birds, and various invertebrates such as snails, scorpions, spiders, and caterpillars also being consumed. Males may engage in food scrounging from females. The ibis uses its long bill to probe the loose, sandy soil for food items as it moves across the ground. A soft surface and sparse vegetation, not exceeding 15\u201320 cm in height, are crucial for successful hunting.","bird_img":["baldibis.jpg"],"bird_scale":5}

While both sexes share a similar appearance, the male distinguishes himself with a more extended crest compared to the female.\n\nIt's worth noting that a related species, the black-winged myna (Acridotheres melanopterus), bears similarities but can be differentiated by its shorter crest. Additionally, the black-winged myna possesses a more extensive black area on its wings and tail, along with a yellow eye-ring devoid of feathers and yellow legs.","bird_distr":"The Bali myna is confined to the island of Bali, including its surrounding offshore islands, situated in Indonesia. Remarkably, it stands as the sole endemic vertebrate species on the island. Recognizing its significance, the bird was bestowed the title of the faunal emblem of Bali in 1991. This avian species is prominently featured on the Indonesian 200 rupiah coin, bearing the local name \"jalak Bali\" in the Balinese script, written as \u1b1a\u1b2e\u1b13\u1b44\u1b29\u1b2e\u1b36.","bird_eco":"In its native habitat, the Bali myna adopts a discreet demeanor, seeking refuge in the canopies of trees for cover. Distinguishing itself from other starlings, it typically descends to the ground solely for drinking or procuring nesting materials, likely an adaptation to minimize its visibility to potential predators when in open spaces. Notably, the Bali myna tends to congregate in groups during its early stages of life, enhancing its ability to locate food and remain vigilant against potential threats. Vocalizations include a repertoire of sharp chattering calls and an assertive tweet.\n\nThe diet of the Bali myna encompasses a variety of sustenance, including fruit, seeds, worms, and insects.\n\nBreeding activities unfold during the Bali myna's breeding season, coinciding with the island's rainy period. Male individuals engage in attracting females through vocal displays, emitting loud calls and rhythmic bobbing movements. Nesting occurs within tree cavities, where the female lays and incubates two or three eggs. Following hatching, both male and female contribute to nourishing the chicks by bringing food to the nest.","bird_img":["balistarling.jpg"],"bird_scale":3}

Characterized by a robust body, a moderately long tail, fairly extended legs, and a stout, pointed bill, their average body weight is 33.8 g (1.19 oz), with individual weights spanning from 22.3 to 42 g (0.79 to 1.48 oz). The male oriole is marginally larger than the female, although the size difference is modest in comparison to other icterids. Adults consistently feature white bars on their wings.\n\nThe mature male displays a striking orange hue on the underparts, shoulder patch, and rump. The intensity of the orange coloration varies among individuals, ranging from a deep flaming orange to a more yellowish-orange tone. The remainder of the male's plumage is predominantly black. In contrast, the adult female exhibits yellow-brown upper parts with darker wings and a subdued orange-yellow shade on the breast and belly. The juvenile oriole shares a resemblance with the female, and male individuals take until the fall of their second year to acquire their adult plumage.","bird_distr":"Baltimore orioles inhabit the Nearctic region during the summer months, ranging from the Canadian Prairies and eastern Montana in the northwest, eastward through southern Ontario, southern Quebec, and New Brunswick, and extending south through the eastern United States to central Mississippi, Alabama, and northern Georgia. During winter, they migrate to the Neotropics, reaching as far north as Mexico and occasionally the southern coast of the United States. However, they predominantly winter in Central America and northern South America. In some southern United States areas, orioles may remain throughout the winter if suitable feeders are available. The Baltimore oriole's range intersects with that of the similar Bullock's oriole in the Midwest, and these two species were once considered conspecific due to their ability to produce fertile hybrids, collectively referred to as the northern oriole. The Baltimore oriole is an infrequent vagrant to Western Europe.\n\nTypically, Baltimore orioles are found in elevated positions within large, leafy deciduous trees, though they do not commonly inhabit deep forests. During summer and migration, they can be observed in open woodlands, forest edges, and partially wooded wetlands or areas with trees along rivers. Highly adaptable, they can breed in various secondary habitats, and in recent times, they have been observed in orchards, farmland, urban parks, and suburban landscapes, provided there are woodlots present. In Mexico, during the winter season, they frequent flowering canopy trees, often over shade coffee plantations.\n\nFrom 1966 to 2015, the Baltimore oriole has faced an annual population decrease of over 1.5% throughout the northern and eastern parts of its breeding range. This decline can be attributed to factors such as Dutch elm disease, which significantly reduced suitable nesting locations, particularly elm trees.","bird_eco":"The Baltimore oriole is known for its distinctive song, characterized by a set of sweet whistles such as \"tyew,\" \"pyeer,\" \"peededoo,\" and \"teer.\" Various calls include a nasal \"veeer,\" a low chatter, and high calls resembling \"tyew-li\" and \"kleek.\" The male's song is a vibrant, clear whistle with paired and repeated notes lasting 1-2 seconds, often accompanied by a flutter-drum sound during flight. Female orioles also sing and emit a distinctive screech while protecting their nests. Both genders produce warning calls, inharmonious chatter, during confrontations, eliciting responses from other orioles in the area.\n\nDuring the breeding season, Baltimore orioles are primarily solitary, establishing territories and engaging in displays to attract mates. Males sing, chatter, and perform bow displays, while females may respond with calls or a wing-quiver display. Nest building is the female's responsibility, and the nest is a tightly woven, bindle-like pouch suspended from a branch. The clutch typically consists of three to seven pale gray to bluish-white eggs, with an incubation period of 12 to 14 days. Once hatched, the nestlings are fed by both parents and become largely independent after two weeks.\n\nMortality factors for Baltimore orioles include predation by various birds and mammals, with common predators including grackles, crows, jays, magpies, squirrels, and domestic cats. Raptors such as screech owls, Cooper's hawks, and sharp-shinned hawks also pose a threat. Predatory birds like peregrine falcons, great horned owls, barn owls, and merlins may opportunistically prey on orioles. The species can live up to 11 years and 7 months in the wild and up to 14 years in captivity.\n\nBaltimore orioles exhibit diverse feeding behaviors, foraging in trees and shrubs, catching insects in flight, and sipping nectar from flowers and hummingbird feeders. They prefer ripe, dark-colored fruits, showcasing a particular fondness for forest tent caterpillar moths. Orioles play a crucial role in controlling these caterpillars, which can be harmful to forest trees. Additionally, they readily consume beetles, grasshoppers, wasps, bugs, and spiders. Orioles are attracted to backyard feeders offering nectar, fruit, jelly, and halved oranges, and they play a vital role in ecosystems by contributing to pest control and pollination.","bird_img":["baltimoreoriole.jpg"],"bird_scale":2}

While it thrives in a diverse array of open to semi-open environments, including gardens and parks, it tends to be scarce or absent in deserts, dense forests like large portions of the Amazon rainforest, and at altitudes surpassing 2,000 meters (6,600 feet). Occasionally, individuals from the Bahamas may visit Florida, marking a rare occurrence in that region.","bird_eco":"The bananaquit possesses a slender, curved bill well-suited for extracting nectar from flowers, including mistletoes. This adaptation for nectivory is considered an independent innovation in the Coereba genus. The tongue of C. flaveola has undergone convergent evolution with other birds that feed on similar flowers, while the source flowers have adapted to accommodate its specialized tongue. The bananaquit occasionally engages in nectar robbing, piercing flowers from the side to extract nectar without participating in the pollination process. In addition to its nectar-based diet, it feeds on fruits, including mistletoe fruits and ripe bananas, as reflected in its common name. The bird has been observed puncturing fruits to extract their sweet juices and occasionally consumes small insects, larvae, and other arthropods like spiders.\n\nRemarkably adaptable to human environments, the bananaquit frequently visits gardens and can become quite tame. Its nickname, the sugar bird, is derived from its fondness for granular sugar placed in bowls or bird feeders. When constructing nests, the bananaquit builds a spherical structure with a side entrance hole, laying up to three eggs that are solely incubated by the female. Interestingly, it may also build nests in human-made objects such as lampshades and garden trellises. Notably, these birds breed throughout the year, irrespective of the season, and are known to construct new nests consistently.","bird_img":["bananaquits.jpg"],"bird_scale":1}

Adult males of the nominate subspecies showcase a glossy purple-red head transitioning to black towards the lores and base of the bill. The neckband, often faint or absent in Borneo and Java males, adds to their unique appearance. The upper back is maroon-tinged dark brown, with the remaining back being predominantly black, interrupted by a central line of yellow streaks. The underparts exhibit a pale pinkish-violet to wine-red hue, with a gray tinge on the chin and upper breast, and a distinct gray breast-band. Notably, the banded broadbill boasts a broad, hooked turquoise blue beak, edged in green or black, and a wide tongue, facilitating the mashing and \"chewing\" of its relatively large prey. Females, lacking a neckband and with grayer heads and underparts, closely resemble males. Juveniles display pale brown heads, yellow supercilium, and gradually transition from yellow to purple-pink plumage as they mature.\n\nThe bird's plumage coloration is influenced by pigments like 2,3-didehydro-papilioerythrinone for reddish hues and carotenoid 7,8-dihydro-3\u2032-dehydro-lutein for yellow tones.\n\nThe banded broadbill's vocalization includes a remarkable song characterized by a short, loud wheeoo or wiuk, often preceded by whirr notes and followed by a high-speed rattling trill. This song is frequently exchanged between pairs of birds, triggered by sudden loud sounds or playback. Other calls include nasal whee-u, squeaky kyeeow, keowrr, and a squealing keek-eek-eek reminiscent of the black-and-red broadbill. Soft calls during wing displays are lower and less squeaky than those of the black-and-yellow broadbills.","bird_distr":"The banded broadbill is distributed across Mainland Southeast Asia and the Greater Sunda Islands. In Indochina, its range includes southern and central Vietnam, most of western and southern Thailand, extensive areas of Cambodia excluding the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, southern and central Laos, as well as the Tenasserim Hills and Karen Hills in southeastern Myanmar. Within the Greater Sunda Islands, the species is found in Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Belitung, Bangka Island, the North Natuna Islands, and the Riau Archipelago. There are historical records suggesting local extinction in Singapore around 1928, and reports of its presence on Penang Island remain unconfirmed. While generally non-migratory, observations of individuals in a tract of secondary forest on a former rubber plantation in Kuala Lumpur over three years indicate a degree of wandering behavior when typical habitat is lost.\n\nThe banded broadbill occupies various forest types, including primary forests, selectively logged and regrown forests, peat swamp forests, high-altitude heath forests, freshwater swamp forests, forest edges, rubber plantations, and groves of Falcataria falcata. Commonly found in evergreen and mixed deciduous forests on the mainland, the species is also observed in adjacent gardens, villages, and secondary forests. On Java, it is often seen at forest edges, particularly on mountain slopes. Despite being primarily a lowland species, the banded broadbill has been recorded at elevations up to 1,220 meters (4,000 feet) in different regions of its range. The altitudinal range varies, with its occurrence reported at different elevations in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Laos, Cambodia, and Borneo. In Java, the species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 485 to 1,500 meters.","bird_eco":"The banded broadbill, despite its vibrant coloration, is often challenging to observe due to its sluggish behavior. Its distinctive displays, including wing and gaping displays similar to those of the black-and-yellow broadbill, contribute to its visibility. Wing displays involve raising the wings slightly above the back and then opening and closing the flight feathers, often accompanied by a tail wag. Gaping displays consist of measuredly opening and closing the bill without vocalizations. These displays occur both in solitude and in the presence of other banded broadbills, sometimes near nests and may be accompanied by soft calls.\n\nFeeding primarily on arthropods, small vertebrates, and fruits, the banded broadbill's diet includes grasshoppers, true bugs, snails, spiders, beetles, and small fruits like Ficus figs. It has been observed eating lizards up to 10 cm in length and frogs, consuming them head-first. The species employs a toothed bill-tip for foraging and typically exhibits a slow and deliberate foraging style. The broadbill often takes off from high perches, captures prey from nearby branches and undersides of leaves, and spends extended periods motionless except for probing head movements.\n\nBreeding in the banded broadbill occurs during specific seasons across its range. Nests are usually constructed at heights of 6\u201321 m over clearings or water bodies, hanging from dead or living trees. Nest-building materials include leaves, twigs, roots, fibres, moss, leaf skeletons, grass stems, and bryophytes. Nests are large, raggedy, oval or pear-shaped, and may be embellished with lichen, bryophytes, insect excreta, cocoons, and cobwebs for camouflage. The eggs are oval-shaped, with a smooth surface and dull white color, often adorned with dark purple or reddish-brown flecks. Clutches typically consist of two or three eggs, with incubation starting even before nest completion. While details about hatching and parental care are limited, parents continue to provide a significant portion of food to the young several weeks after fledging.","bird_img":["bandedbroadbill.jpg"],"bird_scale":3}

When foraging, these birds adopt a quiet approach on the forest floor, meticulously searching through leaf litter for invertebrates like beetles, ants, and termites.\n\nIn terms of behavior, Malayan banded pittas are known for their shy and secretive nature. Their cryptic plumage and preference for ground-dwelling habits often make them challenging to observe. Despite their elusive tendencies, they are vocal creatures, producing various calls, including a subdued roar and a short, descending \"pr-r-r-r-r.\"\n\nIn matters of breeding, these birds are monogamous. They construct cup-shaped nests either on the ground or in low vegetation. The female typically lays a clutch of 2-3 eggs, and both parents contribute to the incubation process, which lasts approximately 16-18 days. Once the chicks hatch, they fledge after about 18-20 days and continue to receive care from the parents for several weeks until they attain independence.","bird_img":["bandedpita.jpg"],"bird_scale":2}

Its wingspan measures between 55 to 68 cm (22 to 27 inches). In breeding plumage, adults display predominantly white feathers with black wings and a distinctive u-shaped chestnut band across the breast. The upper tail's central base has a pale grey-brown tint. The slender, relatively straight bill is black and approximately twice the length of the head. Dark brown irises, along with dark red-pink legs and feet, complement the bird's appearance. During flight, the wings appear mostly black from above, with a white trailing edge. From underneath, the wings are predominantly white with dark tips. Non-breeding plumage is similar, but the chest band is less distinct, often diluted to an ashy brown or mottled with white. Juveniles resemble adults but have a greyish forehead and lores, duller black wings, and lack the characteristic breast band. Adult plumage is attained in the second year.\n\nThe banded stilt is a distinctive bird, making it difficult to confuse with other species. Notably, the white-headed stilt lacks the breast band, and the red-necked avocet has a chestnut head and neck, along with a distinctly upcurved bill.\n\nAdults produce a barking call, often described as \"cow\" or \"chowk,\" sometimes with two syllables as \"chowk-uk\" or \"chuk-uk.\" They also engage in soft and tuneful chatter while nesting.","bird_distr":"The banded stilt is predominantly found in southern Australia, particularly in Western Australia where it is concentrated in the southwestern corner, extending as far north as the saltworks in Port Hedland. Breeding instances have been recorded at various locations, including Lake Ballard in the Goldfields-Esperance after heavy rainfall from Cyclone Bobby in 1995 and subsequent flooding in 2014. Historical records note a large colony at Lake Grace in 1933, which unfortunately succumbed to attacks, likely by foxes. The bird's presence has been observed in southeastern South Australia, the drainage of the Lake Eyre system, and parts of Victoria west of Port Phillip and the Wimmera. Notably, in July 2010, around 150,000 banded stilts flocked to Lake Torrens after it filled with water. The Natimuk-Douglas Wetlands in western Victoria are recognized as an important nesting ground for the species, with lower numbers visiting during flooding elsewhere in southeastern Australia. In New South Wales, it is commonly found in the Riverina and western regions, extending to southern Queensland and the Northern Territory, including locations like the sewage ponds at Alice Springs and Erldunda. Vagrant occurrences have been noted in Tasmania, with significant numbers recorded in 1981.\n\nThe banded stilt favors large, shallow saline or hypersaline lakes, both inland and near the coast. This includes ephemeral salt lakes, saltworks, lagoons, salt- or claypans, and intertidal flats. Additionally, the species occasionally ventures into brackish or fresh water, such as farm dams and sewage ponds.\n\nKnown for its high level of nomadism, the banded stilt adeptly responds to the unpredictable climate of Australia's arid interior. Sudden rainfall leads to the filling of dry inland salt lakes, prompting the stilts to travel to these areas for breeding. They then disperse and return to the coast as the lakes begin to dry up. The mechanism by which banded stilts on the coast become aware of inland rainfall remains unknown. Notably, these birds can cover considerable distances; for instance, two individuals were tracked traveling from a drying Lake Eyre in South Australia to a newly filled lake system in Western Australia, spanning over 1,500 km (930 mi). One of these birds took a northwest route over the Gibson Desert, covering a minimum distance of 2,263 km (1,406 mi) in 55.9 hours.","bird_eco":"The banded stilt is a sociable species, typically encountered in groups ranging from small troops of tens of birds to large flocks numbering in the tens of thousands.\n\nBreeding habits of the banded stilt remained largely unknown until 1930 when a colony was discovered at Lake Grace. In 2012, researcher Reece Pedler and colleagues utilized tracking devices on 21 birds, revealing their extensive inland movements. Breeding events are predominantly observed at inland salt lakes in South Australia and Western Australia, following freshwater inflows. This occurs whenever shallow inland lakes fill after rainfall, leading to an increase in food sources like Parartemia brine shrimp. Breeding can occur at any time of the year. Breeding sites are typically low islands or spits on or alongside large lakes, with nests being soil scrapes, 15 cm (5.9 in) across and 3 cm (1 in) deep, often lined with dead vegetation or gathered vegetation on stony soils.\n\nEgg clutches consist of three to four (or rarely five) oval eggs, varying in color from fawn to white marked with brown to black splotches. The eggs measure 49\u201358 mm (1.9\u20132.3 in) in length and 35\u201348 mm (1.4\u20131.9 in) in width. Incubation, lasting 19 to 21 days, involves both parents, with the male taking over as the sole incubator after hatching. This allows the female to potentially lay and incubate a second brood if conditions permit. Parent birds change over incubating duties, usually at night to avoid predators.\n\nNestlings are born precocial, covered in white down, and leave the nest soon after hatching. Adults guide the young birds to water by the age of two days, where they begin feeding on tiny crustaceans.\n\nBanded stilt colonies face predation challenges, particularly from silver gulls, while wedge-tailed eagles, white-bellied sea eagles, spot-bellied eagle-owls, and black falcons are known to target stilts and their young. Premature drying of lakes can lead to parents abandoning eggs or nestlings, resulting in significant losses. Nest predators and hazards include silver gulls, wedge-tailed eagles, white-bellied sea eagles, spot-bellied eagle-owls, and black falcons. Premature drying of lakes can lead to parents abandoning eggs or nestlings, resulting in significant losses.\n\nThe banded stilt forages by walking or swimming in shallow water, employing various feeding behaviors such as pecking, probing, or scything into the water or mud.

Males, on average smaller than females, exhibit a weight range of 190 to 400 g (6.7 to 14.1 oz), while females weigh between 260 and 630 g (9.2 to 22.2 oz). There is some regional variation in size, as seen in different subspecies.\n\nIn breeding plumage, adults feature blue-grey legs, a long, tapering, and slightly upturned bill that is pink at the base and black towards the tip. The neck, breast, and belly display an unbroken brick-red coloration in breeding males, while females exhibit a duller chestnut to cinnamon belly. The full breeding plumage becomes apparent by the third year, with noticeable differences in coloration between immature and mature males during their first northward migration. Non-breeding individuals in the Southern Hemisphere appear plain grey-brown with darker feather centers, creating a striped appearance, and a whitish underside. Juveniles resemble non-breeding adults but with an overall buff hue and streaked plumages on the flanks and breast.\n\nBar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska show a size increase from north to south, but this trend is not observed in their non-breeding grounds in New Zealand, where birds of varying sizes freely interact. The species can be differentiated from the black-tailed godwit by its black-and-white horizontally-barred tail and the absence of white wing bars. The Asiatic dowitcher (Limnodromus semipalmatus) is the most similar species.","bird_distr":"All bar-tailed godwits undergo a remarkable migratory pattern, spending the Northern Hemisphere summer in the Arctic for breeding and embarking on a long-distance migration south during winter to more temperate regions. The extent of their migration varies among subspecies, with some traveling only to the North Sea, while others undertake journeys as far as India.\n\nNotably, bar-tailed godwits nesting in Alaska (L. l. baueri) embark on an extraordinary migration to eastern Australia and New Zealand. This migration stands as the longest non-stop journey of any bird, with individuals carrying substantial fat loads, the highest among migratory birds studied to date. To support such lengthy flights, they reduce the size of their digestive organs.\n\nThe subspecies L. l. baueri breeds in Alaska and spends the non-breeding season in eastern Australia and New Zealand, covering an immense distance of approximately 11,000 km (6,835 mi). In contrast, L. l. menzbieri, breeding in Siberia, migrates to northern and western Australia. Interestingly, birds breeding in Siberia follow the coast of Asia northwards and southwards, while those breeding in Alaska migrate directly across the Pacific to Australasia, covering a distance of 11,000 km (6,835 mi).\n\nSome bar-tailed godwits have been tracked with surgically-implanted transmitters, revealing astonishing flight records. For instance, a female nicknamed \"E7\" flew from China to Alaska, and in August 2007, she undertook an eight-day non-stop flight from Alaska to New Zealand, covering a record distance of 11,680 km (7,258 mi). In 2021, a male bar-tailed godwit, 4BBRW, set a new record with an approximately 13,035 km (8,100 mi) non-stop flight from Alaska to New South Wales, Australia. Additionally, in 2022, a tagged godwit flew non-stop from Alaska to Tasmania, covering a minimum distance of 13,560 km (8,430 mi) in 11 days and 1 hour.\n\nThe remarkable ability of these birds to predict weather patterns and depart early from New Zealand when favorable winds are present adds another layer to their extraordinary migratory behavior. The timing of their departure, size differences among individuals, and the two-wave arrival at the breeding grounds in Alaska demonstrate the complexity and adaptability of their migration strategy.","bird_eco":"The bar-tailed godwit exhibits non-breeding migration patterns in Australia and New Zealand, with birds departing for their northern hemisphere breeding sites typically between the ages of 2 and 4. Breeding occurs annually in regions such as Scandinavia, northern Asia, and Alaska. The nest is a shallow cup made in moss and may be lined with vegetation. Clutch sizes range from 2 to 5 eggs, with an average of four. Incubation is shared by both sexes for 20 to 21 days, with the female taking daytime shifts and the male covering incubation at night.\n\nThe primary food source for bar-tailed godwits in wetlands consists of bristle-worms, making up a substantial portion, up to 70%, of their diet. This is supplemented by small bivalves and crustaceans. In wet pastures, they feed on invertebrates. At significant staging sites like the northern Yellow Sea, their diet primarily includes the bivalve mollusc Potamocorbula laevis, which they often swallow whole, although they continue to hunt polychaetes as well.\n\nMale bar-tailed godwits, being smaller than females and possessing shorter bills, exhibit distinct feeding preferences. In a study at the Manawat\u016b Estuary, it was observed that shorter-billed birds (males) specialized in consuming small surface prey like Potamopyrgus snails, while females preferred more deeply-buried prey such as worms. Individual food preferences were also noted among the birds.","bird_img":["bartailedgodwit.jpg"],"bird_scale":4}

The Galapagos male barn owl weighs around 260 g, while the Pacific male barn owls average 555 g. There is a correlation between the size and weight of barn owls and the ecosystems they inhabit, with smaller and lighter owls found on smaller islands, possibly due to a higher dependence on insect prey and the need for increased maneuverability.\n\nDistinguishing features of the barn owl include its undulating flight pattern, dangling feathered legs, and a distinctive appearance in flight with a pale face shaped like a heart and oversized, oblique black eyeslits, resembling a flat mask. The head and upper body typically vary in color between pale brown and various shades of grey, with black-and-white speckles except on the main wing feathers. The heart-shaped face is usually bright white, but in some subspecies, it may be brown.\n\nFemales tend to have more spotting on the underside and are generally larger than males. The bill, iris, toes, and talons display variation in color within the population.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the barn owl does not hoot like typical owls. Instead, it produces a characteristic piercing shree scream, a long-drawn-out shriek that is ear-shattering at close range. Males in courtship emit a shrill twitter, while both young and old can hiss like a snake for defensive purposes. Other sounds include purring chirrups denoting pleasure and a \"kee-yak\" similar to some vocalizations of the tawny owl. When threatened, the barn owl may emit rasping sounds or clicking snaps, possibly produced by the bill or tongue, while employing an effective defensive tactic of flailing with sharp-taloned feet when captured or cornered.","bird_distr":"The barn owl holds the distinction of being the most widespread landbird species globally, found on every continent except Antarctica. Its extensive range encompasses all of Europe, excluding Fennoscandia and Malta, most of Africa (except the Sahara), the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Australia, numerous Pacific Islands, and North-, Central-, and South America. Generally considered sedentary, many individuals establish residence in specific locations, even when better foraging areas are nearby. In the British Isles, young barn owls tend to disperse along river corridors, with an average travel distance of approximately 9 km from their natal site.\n\nIn continental Europe, dispersal distances typically range between 50 and 100 kilometers, but exceptions include cases of up to 1,500 km. In the United States, dispersal usually spans 80 to 320 km, with some individuals traveling up to 1,760 km from their origin points. African dispersal movements cover distances of up to 1,000 km, from Senegambia to Sierra Leone, and within South Africa, movements of up to 579 km have been recorded. In Australia, barn owls display some migration behavior, moving towards the northern coast in the dry season and southward during the wet season. Nomadic movements also occur in association with rodent plagues. Occasionally, barn owls have been found on Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, or New Zealand, demonstrating their capability to cross oceans. In 2008, barn owls were recorded breeding in New Zealand. Additionally, barn owls have been introduced to the Hawaiian island of Kauai to control rodents, although they have been observed feeding on native birds, causing concern.","bird_eco":"The barn owl, a nocturnal hunter, relies on its acute sense of hearing for hunting in complete darkness. While typically active shortly before dusk, it may be seen during the day when relocating between roosting sites. In some regions, such as Britain and certain Pacific Islands, it occasionally hunts during the day, possibly influenced by the avoidance of mobbing by other birds. The bird displays varied roosting behavior, with females and males roosting separately outside the breeding season. The barn owl is not highly territorial but establishes a home range within which it forages.\n\nPreferring open country, farmland, or grassland with interspersed woodland, the barn owl exhibits effortless flight, characterized by silent gliding and hovering. Its diet primarily consists of rodents, with voles being a common choice. The bird's unique hunting abilities, including acute hearing and silent flight, contribute to its effectiveness in locating prey. Farmers often value barn owls for their role in controlling rodent pests, making them economically beneficial.\n\nBreeding habits involve cavity nesting, with tree holes, cliffs, and man-made structures being preferred nesting sites. Mating pairs exhibit monogamy, and the female lays an average of five eggs. Chicks develop rapidly, with the male providing food until they are at least four weeks old. The barn owl undergoes a prolonged molt, shedding and replacing feathers over two years.\n\nPredators include larger owls, eagles, and carnivorous mammals. Defensive behaviors include hissing, snapping, and adopting defensive postures. Barn owls host various parasites, including fleas, lice, mites, and internal parasites acquired through infected prey. The species exhibits r-selection, producing numerous offspring with a high growth rate but a lower probability of survival to adulthood. The typical lifespan is around four years, with starvation, collisions with vehicles, and pesticide exposure identified as common causes of mortality.","bird_img":["barnowl.jpg"],"bird_scale":4}

The outer tail feathers are elongated, resulting in the distinctive deeply forked \"swallow tail,\" marked by a line of white spots across the outer end of the upper tail. The female shares a similar appearance with the male, but her tail streamers are shorter, the gloss of the upperparts and breast band is less pronounced, and the underparts are paler. Juveniles are characterized by a browner hue, a lighter rufous face, and whiter underparts, lacking the long tail streamers of adults.\n\nBoth male and female barn swallows are capable of singing, with female song recently described. Various calls include witt or witt-witt, and a loud splee-plink when agitated or attempting to deter intruders from the nest. Alarm calls consist of a sharp siflitt for predators like cats and a flitt-flitt for birds of prey such as the hobby. The species tends to be relatively quiet during its wintering period.\n\nThe unique combination of a red face and blue breast band makes it easy to distinguish the adult barn swallow from African Hirundo species and the welcome swallow (Hirundo neoxena) with which it shares its range in Australasia. In Africa, the short tail streamers of the juvenile barn swallow may be confused with the juvenile red-chested swallow (Hirundo lucida), but the latter can be differentiated by its narrower breast band and greater white markings in the tail.","bird_distr":"The barn swallow prefers open country with low vegetation, including pasture, meadows, and farmland, particularly if there is nearby water. It avoids heavily wooded or precipitous areas and densely built-up locations. The presence of accessible open structures like barns, stables, or culverts for nesting sites, as well as exposed locations such as wires, roof ridges, or bare branches for perching, is crucial in selecting its breeding range.\n\nBarn swallows are semi-colonial, forming groups ranging from a single pair to a few dozen pairs, especially in larger wooden structures housing animals. Many individuals return to the same breeding site each year, and old nests are highly valued due to the considerable effort required to build new ones.\n\nThis species breeds across the Northern Hemisphere, from sea level to 2,700 m (8,900 ft), reaching up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) in the Caucasus and North America. It is absent only from deserts and the cold northernmost regions of the continents. In Europe, it tends to avoid towns, being replaced in urban areas by the house martin. However, in parts of Japan, the barn swallow is more urban, with the red-rumped swallow taking its place in rural settings.\n\nDuring winter, the barn swallow is cosmopolitan in its choice of habitat, avoiding only dense forests and deserts. It is most common in open, low vegetation habitats such as savannas and ranch lands. In some regions, like Venezuela, South Africa, and Trinidad and Tobago, it is particularly attracted to burnt or harvested sugarcane fields and their waste. Roosting on wires may occur in the absence of suitable roost sites, even though it exposes them to predators. Individual birds tend to return to the same wintering locality each year, and large congregations roost in reed beds, offering protection from predators. These roosts can be enormous, with some recorded to have around 1.5 million birds. Notably, the barn swallow has been observed breeding in the more temperate parts of its winter range, such as the mountains of Thailand and central Argentina.\n\nMigration patterns of barn swallows between Britain and South Africa were established in 1912, with recorded vagrants reaching distant locations like Hawaii, Bermuda, Greenland, Tristan da Cunha, the Falkland Islands, and even Antarctica.","bird_eco":"The barn swallow, a skilled aerial insectivore, has a distinctive appearance with steel blue upperparts and a rufous forehead, chin, and throat.

They forage 7\u20138 meters above ground, following animals or farm machinery. During migration, communal roosts in reed beds serve as important resting and feeding sites.\n\nBreeding involves the male returning first, advertising the nest site through flight displays and songs. Mating pairs exhibit strong territorial behavior. Nesting inside buildings, they construct cup-shaped nests using mud pellets and line them with various materials. Females typically lay 2-7 eggs, with two broods being common. The fledglings stay with the parents for about a week after leaving the nest.\n\nThe barn swallow faces threats from predators such as accipiters, falcons, and owls.

Throughout their migration, which includes spring and fall, they can be observed across the eastern United States, navigating various vegetative communities. Notably, many of these warblers undertake a long-distance journey, crossing the Gulf of Mexico, while others opt for a route along the Mexican shore.","bird_eco":"During the breeding season, bay-breasted warblers primarily feed on insects and spiders, with a particular emphasis on the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). They glean these prey items from vegetation, adopting a strategy of not catching them on the wing. To minimize competition with similar species, bay-breasted warblers concentrate their foraging activities on the breeding grounds within the interior middle portions of coniferous trees. In their wintering grounds in the tropics, their diet shifts predominantly to fruit. During this time, they often form mixed-species flocks with other neotropical migrants and resident species, displaying assertive behavior as they compete for food sources in the forest canopy.\n\nFor breeding, bay-breasted warblers typically construct cup-shaped nests in the lower portion of spruce or fir trees. These nests are primarily composed of plant material, often incorporating spider silk. The average clutch size consists of 4-7 whitish eggs with dark spots.

The mature male showcases a grey head, black \"moustaches\" (as opposed to a beard), and black undertail coverts. Conversely, the adult female appears generally paler, with a more brownish head and the absence of black moustaches or undertail coverts, although occasional black streaks or spots may be present on the crown or back.\n\nJuveniles of both genders resemble the adult female but with an overall buffier coloration. They possess a roughly rectangular black patch on the back, extending beyond the markings on adult females, and extensive black on the tail feathers. The juvenile male is identified by a prominent black loreal patch and a bright orange-yellow bill, while the juvenile female features a smaller dusky-grey loreal patch and a bill that ranges from blackish to brownish or yellowish-dusky.\n\nDuring late summer\u2013autumn, adults undergo a single complete moult, starting in August after the breeding season and concluding approximately 50 days later. Juvenile bearded reedlings undergo a post-juvenile moult, beginning in late July\u2013early September and culminating in the acquisition of adult plumage by October. This unique moulting pattern enables recently hatched individuals to resemble older adults by autumn.\n\nThese birds, often concealed by their well-camouflaged plumage in dense reed bed habitats, can be inconspicuous but are readily identified by their characteristic metallic \"ping\" call, employed for intergroup communication. The male's song is described as a melodious \"tschin-schik-schra,\" while the flapping of their short wings during flight produces a distinctive whirring sound.","bird_distr":"The bearded reedling inhabits temperate regions of Europe and Asia, spanning from Spain, France, and the British Isles to the Manchurian region. Its distribution, however, is characterized by sporadic occurrences due to its specific habitat preferences. While maps often depict a seemingly continuous Asian range, this is a result of limited monitoring data in comparison to the more detailed information available for the western part of its range.\n\nHistorically confined to mid and low latitudes in Europe, including Great Britain, the species has expanded its range northward into Scandinavia, Finland, and the northern Baltics during the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nOccasionally, the bearded reedling ventures beyond its breeding range, appearing as a non-breeding visitor in Cyprus and Iran. Rare vagrant records exist in Portugal, North Africa, Israel, Kuwait, Pakistan, Japan, and Korea, showcasing occasional occurrences outside its typical distribution.\n\nThe species exhibits a resident behavior without a clear and consistent migration pattern. However, certain European populations engage in short-distance migrations during the non-breeding period, predominantly toward the south or southwest of their breeding range. This pattern is observed mainly in the northern half of the continent, with variations among individual birds in terms of migration participation.\n\nAs a habitat specialist, the bearded reedling thrives in reed beds, particularly those featuring common reed, adjacent to freshwater or brackish water bodies such as lakes, swamps, or rivers. It also occupies tall grass-like vegetation, including bulrushes and true sedges in the vicinity. During the breeding season, the species avoids non-floodable or dry portions of wetlands but may exhibit more extensive movement at other times. While commonly found perched or climbing on reeds, it readily navigates the ground, especially in swampy areas or along water's edge. The bearded reedling demonstrates versatility in altitude, typically ranging from sea level to medium altitudes but has been recorded at elevations up to 3,050 m (10,010 ft) in China.","bird_eco":"The bearded reedling exhibits social behavior, forming groups during the non-breeding season, typically ranging from a few individuals to up to two hundred. In contrast, during the breeding season, it is commonly observed in pairs, family groups, or gatherings of independent young. Remarkably, young individuals form pairs while still juvenile, and these pairings tend to be lifelong, enduring throughout the year.\n\nBreeding occurs in spring and summer, with typically two to three broods in a season. A pair may nest alone or as part of a small, loosely organized colony. Monogamous pairs engage in nest building together, with both sexes participating in the construction of the cup-shaped nest attached to reeds or similar vegetation. The nest's diameter ranges from 7.5 to 17 cm, positioned at various heights, including near ground or water level.\n\nBoth sexes contribute to the up to two-week-long incubation of 3 to 11 eggs, followed by a nestling period of about two weeks. After leaving the nest, young continue to rely on parental care for up to two weeks. In years with a low population density, a pair may start a new brood in a nearby nest before the previous one has left.\n\nDuring the summer, the bearded reedling primarily consumes adult insects, larvae, pupae, and other small invertebrates, providing the same to their nestlings and fledglings. In late autumn and winter, their diet shifts to seeds of common reed, rushes, common nettle, and other grassy or sedge-like plants. The species demonstrates adaptability in feeding behaviors, including scratching the ground, turning over leaves, and probing into snow.\n\nWhile the average lifespan of bearded reedlings is two to three years, individuals have been recorded living up to seven years and three months. The species is non-territorial in the wild, though some territorial tendencies may emerge in captivity. Notably, bearded reedlings showcase unique mating behaviors, including infidelity, with the length of the male's black \"moustaches\" serving as an honest signal of dominance. Additionally, the presence of a copulatory organ in the male, a relatively large and muscular cloacal protuberance, enhances mating success.","bird_img":["bearedreedling.jpg"],"bird_scale":2}

Moulting occurs in stages in late summer, between January or February and April or May, and is not fully understood.","bird_distr":"Carnaby's black cockatoo is native to a wide area in southwest Australia, primarily within the Wheatbelt region, where the annual rainfall exceeds 300 mm (12 in). Its range extends from Cape Arid to the east, Lake Cronin, Hatters Hill, and Lake Moore inland, to Kalbarri in the north. Breeding occurs in regions receiving 350\u2013700 mm (14\u201328 in) of rainfall annually, including the Stirling Range to Three Springs and areas around Bunbury. Outside the breeding season, cockatoo pairs form flocks, displaying sedentary behavior in wetter regions and migrating to drier areas, moving south and west towards the coast during summer.\n\nPreferred habitats include Eucalyptus woodlands, particularly those dominated by wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) or salmon gum (E. salmonophloia). The cockatoo is also found in proximity to pine plantations, sandplains, or kwongan heath featuring abundant Hakea, Banksia, and Grevillea shrubs.","bird_eco":"Communication in Carnaby's black cockatoo involves auditory and visual displays. The vocal repertoire includes a wailing \"wy-lah\" call, emitted by both sexes in flight or when perched. This call is also used in territorial communication, with variations between individuals. Visual displays include deep, slow wingbeats and gliding movements, particularly during flights. The bird can be agile in quick maneuvers when startled, but on the ground, it exhibits an awkward waddle.\n\nBreeding in Carnaby's black cockatoos begins at four years of age, and they form lifelong monogamous bonds. They rely on large hollows in tall trees for nesting, with mature wandoo and salmon gum woodlands serving as crucial breeding habitat. The breeding season spans late winter to summer, with females laying one or two white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 28 to 29 days, and the chicks fledge ten to eleven weeks after hatching. Feeding primarily involves seeds of proteaceous plants such as Banksia, Hakea, and Grevillea. Carnaby's black cockatoos also contribute to biological control by consuming larvae of wood-boring insects and moths from rare plants.\n\nThe species faces predation from the wedge-tailed eagle, which sporadically preys on adult cockatoos. Additionally, the bird may be parasitized by the bird louse Franciscoloa funerei and is susceptible to nematodes of the genus Ascaris in captivity.","bird_img":["blackcockato.jpeg"],"bird_scale":5}

Characterized by its unique appearance and feeding behavior, it possesses a dorso-ventrally flattened, spatulate bill used for tactile feeding. This method involves wading in water and sweeping the bill from side to side to detect prey.\n\nOriginally common across its range, the black-faced spoonbill now has the most limited distribution among spoonbill species, facing endangerment. Breeding exclusively on small rocky islands off North Korea's west coast, it has designated wintering sites in Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Migration sightings have been reported in Jeju, South Korea, Kyushu and Okinawa, Japan, and the Red River delta in Vietnam. Recent observations also extended its range to Thailand, the Philippines, and additional Chinese sites.\n\nThe IUCN classified the black-faced spoonbill as endangered in 2000, prompted by a near-global extirpation threat in the 1980s. However, collaborative conservation efforts by various Asian countries have contributed to a remarkable population recovery. The 2012 census recorded 2,693 individuals, with approximately 1,600 mature birds. By 2022, the global census revealed a population increase to 6,162 individuals.\n\nThese crepuscular feeders primarily utilize intertidal mudflats for foraging. Conservation initiatives focus on protecting both breeding and wintering sites. Surveys, such as the one conducted by Jin et al. in 2008, explore community attitudes towards conservation, assessing factors like the \"Willingness-To-Pay\" among locals and the impact of mandatory surcharges versus voluntary contributions.","bird_distr":"The global population assessment of the black-faced spoonbill relies on winter counts conducted from 1988 to 1990, revealing a meager estimate of around 288 individuals. Notably, sustained conservation initiatives have yielded significant progress. By 2006, the global population saw a substantial increase to an estimated 1,679 birds. Subsequent censuses demonstrated further growth, with the 2008 count reaching 2,065 individuals and the 2010 census reporting 2,346.\n\nThe specific population in North Korea is known to be localized, with estimates not exceeding 30 birds. However, there is speculation about an undiscovered colony, potentially contributing to regional population stability, thought to be situated in northeastern China, such as the islands of Liaoning near the Korean nesting zone.\n\nGiven the migratory nature of black-faced spoonbills, conservation efforts are intricate, focusing on safeguarding their breeding, stop-over, and wintering grounds. Adaptability to disturbances on a large scale is a notable characteristic of spoonbills. The exact distribution of the species remains somewhat unclear, although attempts have been made to model population trends under the potential impacts of climate change.","bird_eco":"In the 1990s, the black-faced spoonbill faced a critical decline in population, reaching a precarious low. However, by 2003, there was a notable resurgence, with at least 1,069 individuals counted. The breeding area of these spoonbills spans northeastern China and various islands between North and South Korea.\n\nEfforts to facilitate human-assisted breeding have encountered challenges, primarily stemming from difficulties in accurately determining the sex of black-faced spoonbills. Nevertheless, the use of the polymerase chain reaction technique on DNA samples has provided researchers with an alternative method to correctly identify the sex of adult Platalea minor specimens.\n\nDuring their return from wintering locations, black-faced spoonbills exhibit yellow breeding plumage, extending from the back of their heads to their breasts. This distinctive plumage develops only in the third or fourth year of life when the black-faced spoonbill reaches sexual maturity. Interestingly, only about half of black-faced spoonbills sporting this plumage participate in breeding each season, contributing to the gradual pace of population growth.","bird_img":["blackfacedspoonbill.jpeg"],"bird_scale":6}

Scalloped patterns in shades of golden brown adorn the back and wings, complemented by sub-terminal tawny-buff bands and pale edges. The rounded tail is black with narrow white or greyish bars, and the legs and neck showcase reddish-brown to red hues. In contrast, the female displays primarily brown plumage, a chestnut hind neck, and lacks the white cheek patch. The head features brown irises, a brown crown, and a black throat. While sharing similarities in the upper plumage, wings, and tail with the male, the female's coloration is mottled brown instead of black, with wider brown bars on the lower back and tail. Variability exists in the extent of white spotting on the flanks and the depth of coloration in females across the species' range. The distinctive call of the black francolin, described as a loud ringing \"klik cheek-cheek-cheerakik,\" \"kik-kik-kik,\" or \"kwee-kweeeee-kwee,\" resonates in the mornings, evenings, and during the breeding season. The male often calls from elevated positions, and responses echo from various directions. This species, found in Bajoon Village in Uttarakhand, India, can be distinguished from the grey francolin by its black throat, distinct coloration, and unique vocalizations.","bird_distr":"Black francolins, characterized as resident breeders, inhabit regions extending from southeastern Turkey across Iran to southwest Turkmenistan and northeast India, including Kazipara in Panchagarh, Bangladesh. Historically, their range was more extensive, but over-hunting has led to a reduction in distribution and population numbers, resulting in fragmented populations in the western part of their range. Notably, black francolins were introduced to the Calcasieu and Cameron parishes of southwestern Louisiana in 1961, with additional introductions occurring in south Florida. Furthermore, these birds have been introduced to Guam and the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nTheir preferred habitats consist of scrubby environments featuring ample cultivated crops tall enough to provide shelter and an open space beneath for escape routes and easy travel. Black francolins exhibit a preference for areas with thick vegetation, often located near water sources. Although they are not typically found in forested areas, they frequent scrubland and forest edges associated with grassland. Compared to chukars, they appear to have a closer association with water, particularly in drier regions.","bird_eco":"The black francolin is known for its predominantly terrestrial behavior, opting to fly only when disturbed. When it does take flight, the pattern resembles a pheasant's explosive flight, characterized by short and direct movements punctuated by glides on rounded wings. In terms of breeding, these birds exhibit monogamous behavior, nesting in tall grasslands typically from late March to May. During the nesting period, the male attracts attention with its distinctive creaking call, audible throughout April and intermittently in March, May, and the summer months.\n\nBreeding locations are commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and scrub vegetation areas under cultivated crops. The breeding season is marked by a loud call, and males may display aggression, necessitating ample cover and escape routes for the female. In aviculture, it is advisable to house only one pair per aviary, preferably in well-planted aviaries with minimal surrounding traffic for optimal breeding conditions. Black francolins are generally monogamous in the wild.\n\nThe typical clutch size ranges between 10 and 14 eggs, with only the hen responsible for incubation. The eggs have a white-spotted olive or pale brown appearance, and the incubation period lasts for 18 to 19 days. Breeding season spans from April to June, and young birds emerge between April and October.\n\nRegarding feeding habits, black francolins forage on the ground for plant material and small invertebrates, including grains, grass seeds, fallen berries, shoots, tubers, termites, and ants. In aviculture, their diet may include small mealworms and wax worms, although caution is advised when feeding chicks to prevent toe-picking issues.","bird_img":["blackfrancolin.jpg"],"bird_scale":3}

Additionally, they are known to occur in secondary forest areas. While their range includes elevations up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft), their presence is relatively limited above 500 m (1,600 ft), occurring in smaller numbers at higher altitudes.","bird_eco":"### Movement\nThe black-headed parrot exhibits a nomadic behavior in French Guiana, adapting its location based on the fluctuating availability of food. While its movements in other regions have not been extensively documented, the species is typically observed in small flocks, often consisting of up to eight individuals.\n\n### Feeding\nFeeding primarily on seeds, fruit, flowers, and leaves, the black-headed parrot's diet includes palm leaves, seemingly chosen for their mineral content. Unlike some other species, these parrots do not visit clay licks, emphasizing their preference for specific dietary sources.\n\n### Breeding\nThe nesting season of the black-headed parrot varies significantly across its range. In Venezuela, it occurs in April and May, while in Suriname, it takes place in October and November. French Guiana witnesses nesting activities from December to February. The species selects tree cavities for nesting, with clutch sizes believed to range from two to four eggs. In captivity, the incubation period lasts approximately 25 days, and fledging occurs about 10 weeks after hatching.\n\n### Vocalization\nKnown for its distinctive vocalizations, the black-headed parrot emits a high-pitched and penetrating flight call, described as \"skeeea .. skeeea\" or \"a wheezy or squealing screech, e.g., 'scree\u00e9yr, screeyer-screeyer-screeyer.'\" The bird is notably vocal when perched, producing a variety of calls, some musical and others characterized as rather un-birdlike.\n\n### In Aviculture\nBlack-headed parrots are popular choices in aviculture, with owners adopting measures like surgical or DNA sexing to determine gender. DNA sexing is considered a safer option. These playful and energetic pets require spacious cages with various toys and perches, as they tend to hop more than fly. Owners should establish boundaries early on due to the parrot's tendency to bite. While some may poorly mimic human speech, they more commonly replicate surrounding sounds such as alarm clocks, smoke detectors, microwave-oven beeps, laughs, car alarms, and whistles. Additionally, black-headed parrots may creatively combine learned sounds to produce new ones.","bird_img":["blackheadedcaique.jpg"],"bird_scale":3}

They exhibit a white coloration on their undersides, contrasting with black wings and backs. The tail is predominantly white with some grey banding. A continuous black area extends from the back along the hind neck to the head, forming a cap that covers the entire head from the top to just below eye-level. Males display a greenish gloss on the back and wings, particularly during the breeding season, while females may have a brown tinge in these areas. Overall, the sexes appear similar.\n\nDowny young black-necked stilts have a light olive-brown coloration with lengthwise rows of black speckles, larger on the back, and a dull white tone elsewhere, featuring some dark barring on the flanks.\n\nIn regions where the ranges of black-necked and white-backed stilts meet, intergradation occurs. Individuals in these areas may exhibit white or grey on the top of the head and a white or grey collar that separates the black of the hindneck from that of the upper back.\n\nTo distinguish the black-necked stilt from non-breeding vagrants of the black-winged stilt, one can observe the white spot above the eye. Vagrants of the northern American form are challenging to differentiate from the resident Hawaiian stilt, where the eye spot is notably smaller. While many stilt populations are long-distance migrants, actual trans-oceanic vagrants are a rare occurrence, even though they can be found hundreds of miles offshore during their movements.","bird_distr":"The black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) is a versatile bird found in various habitats such as estuarine, lacustrine, salt pond, and emergent wetland environments. While typically a lowland species, it has been observed at altitudes of up to 8,200 ft (2,500 m) ASL in Central America and is commonly seen in llanos habitat in northern South America. Seasonally flooded wetlands also serve as suitable habitats for this bird. In the United States, salt evaporation ponds, particularly in southern San Francisco Bay, have become a significant wintering habitat for black-necked stilts. Notably, they are year-round residents at the Salton Sea.\n\nIn the San Joaquin Valley of California, the black-necked stilt is locally abundant, especially during winter. From April to September, it is common to locally abundant in appropriate habitats in southern California. The bird breeds along lake shores in northeastern California and southeastern Oregon and along the Colorado River. While it rarely breeds inland in North America outside California, it serves as a breeding bird in riparian locales in Arizona and other southern U.S. states. In Arizona, black-necked stilts can be found along artificially created lakes and drainage basins in the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n\nMigration patterns vary, with flocks summering in the northern Central Valley of California migrating to the San Joaquin Valley to join flocks already present. Coastal areas witness both summering and wintering flocks in estuarine settings. Fall migration for northernly birds occurs from July to September, and they return to breeding grounds between March and May. Breeding involves the entire population at a site arriving, mating, incubating eggs for about a month, and caring for the young until they are capable of sustained flight (at 27\u201331 days old). The birds then leave, migrating in flocks, sometimes consisting of juveniles in small groups and other times siblings with family groups. The seasonal movement of tropical populations is less understood and not long-range.\n\nInterestingly, the parasitic cyclocoeline flatworm Neoallopyge americanensis was discovered in the air sacs of a black-necked stilt from Texas. This genus is currently monotypic and appears closely related to the similar genus Allopyge found in Old World cranes.","bird_eco":"The black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) employs a foraging strategy involving probing and gleaning, primarily in mudflats, lakeshores, and very shallow waters near shores. Its diet consists of a variety of aquatic invertebrates, including crustaceans (such as shrimp), other arthropods (such as worms and flies), mollusks, small fish, tadpoles, and occasionally plant seeds. The mainstay food source varies depending on the bird's location, with inland populations mainly feeding on aquatic insects and larvae, while coastal populations predominantly consume other aquatic invertebrates. Preferred feeding areas include coastal estuaries, salt ponds, lakeshores, alkali flats, and even flooded fields. For roosting and resting, the black-necked stilt selects alkali flats (including flooded ones), lake shores, and islands surrounded by shallow water.\n\nBreeding activities of the black-necked stilt are observed in mudflats, desiccated lacustrine verges, and levees, as long as the soil is friable. In North America, reproduction occurs from late April through August, with peak activity in June, while tropical populations typically breed after the rainy season. Nests are usually located within 1 km (0.62 mi) of a feeding location, and pairs defend an extensive perimeter around groups of nests, patrolling cooperatively with neighboring pairs. Nest spacing is approximately 65 ft (20 m), but nests can be as close as 7 ft (2.1 m) or as far as 130 ft (40 m) from each other. The black-necked stilt is considered semicolonial, with nests rarely found alone and colonies numbering dozens, occasionally reaching hundreds of pairs. Nests are often situated close to the water edge, making them vulnerable to rising water levels in ponds or tides, especially in managed salt ponds with rapidly altering water levels during flooding.\n\nThe typical clutch size is 3\u20135 eggs, with an average of four. Both sexes take turns incubating the eggs for 22\u201326 days. The young are highly precocial, swimming within two hours after hatching and demonstrating rapid land velocity. Despite this early development, the young typically return to the nest for resting for an additional one or two days. They fledge after about one month but remain dependent on their parents for a few more weeks. Black-necked stilts begin breeding at 1\u20132 years of age.","bird_img":["blackneckedstilt.jpg"],"bird_scale":3}

This distinctive bird breeds in North and South America, with northern populations undertaking winter migrations to the warmer waters of the Caribbean and the tropical and subtropical Pacific coasts. Conversely, South American populations engage in shorter movements, responding to annual floods that expand their feeding areas within river shallows.\n\nTypically found along coastlines, bays, and estuaries, the black skimmer exhibits a preference for habitats around sandy beaches and mudflats. Their habitat selection is driven by a need for shallow water and calm waves, which are essential for facilitating their unique feeding behavior.","bird_eco":"The black skimmer (Rynchops niger) is known to spend a considerable amount of time gregariously loafing on sandbars in rivers, coasts, and lagoons, forming loose groups during the breeding season. Breeding takes place on sandbanks and sandy beaches in the Americas, where both male and female skimmers incubate three to seven heavily dark-blotched buff or bluish eggs. Once hatched, the chicks leave the nest and lie inconspicuously in the nest depression, shaded from high temperatures by the parents. Occasionally, the chicks may dig their own depressions in the sand. Parents predominantly feed the young during the day, with minimal feeding occurring at night, as the entire population of adults may depart the colony for foraging. The mandibles, initially equal at hatching, rapidly become unequal during fledging.\n\nBlack skimmers exhibit a light and graceful flight, characterized by steady beats of their long wings. They often feed in large flocks, flying low over the water surface, with the lower mandible skimming the water to catch small fish, insects, crustaceans, and mollusks, primarily by touch, both during the day and especially at night. Fish prey species include various types such as Odontesthes argentinenesis, Brevoortia aurea, Anchoa marinii, Lycengraulis grossidens, Engraulis anchoita, Pomatomus saltatrix, Mugil cephalus, Fundulus heteroclitus, Anchoa mitchilli, and Odontesthes incisa.\n\nIn terms of caregiving, female skimmers are more likely to be involved in caring for and feeding their chicks, although male skimmers have been observed feeding larger prey to older chicks. The survival of black skimmer chicks is highly dependent on the availability and quality of adequately sized prey located near the nest site. Young chicks, under six days old, may be fed up to twelve times per day, while older chicks, over twelve days old, are fed at least once per day. They primarily feed during low light levels at night but have also been observed foraging during the daytime in preparation for nighttime feeding.","bird_img":["blackskimmer.jpg"],"bird_scale":4}

Their plumage is predominantly black, accentuated by white flight feathers. The bill is a vibrant red, adorned with a pale bar and tip, while the legs and feet exhibit a greyish-black hue. Cobs (males) are slightly larger than pens (females) and possess a longer and straighter bill. Cygnets, the immature birds, display a greyish-brown coloring with feathers edged in pale hues.\n\nMature black swans typically range in length from 110 to 142 centimeters (43 to 56 inches) and weigh between 3.7 and 9 kilograms (8.2 to 19.8 pounds). Their impressive wingspan spans between 1.6 and 2 meters (5.2 to 6.6 feet). The defining characteristic of the black swan is its long, elegantly curved neck, which stands out as relatively the longest among all swans.\n\nThe black swan communicates through a musical and far-reaching bugle-like sound, emitted both on the water and during flight. Additionally, it produces a variety of softer crooning notes and can whistle, particularly when disturbed during breeding and nesting activities.\n\nWhile swimming, black swans hold their necks arched or erect, often displaying an aggressive posture by raising their feathers or wings. In flight, a formation of black swans adopts a wedge shape, with individuals flying robustly, undulating their long necks, and producing whistling sounds with their wings, accompanied by baying, bugling, or trumpeting calls.\n\nDistinguishing features include a unique skeleton compared to other Australian birds, with the black swan's longer neck and slower wing beat setting it apart. In certain lighting conditions and at a distance, it might be mistaken for a magpie goose in flight. However, careful observation reveals the distinctive characteristics of the black swan.\n\nInterestingly, a captive population in Lakeland, Florida, has produced individuals with a light mottled grey color instead of the typical black. Additionally, white black swans, known as leucistic individuals, are rare in the wild but have been documented.","bird_distr":"The black swan (Cygnus atratus) is a common inhabitant of the wetlands in southwestern and eastern Australia, along with adjacent coastal islands. In the southwest, its range extends from North West Cape to Cape Leeuwin and Eucla, while in the east, it encompasses a vast region bounded by the Atherton Tableland, the Eyre Peninsula, and Tasmania. The Murray Darling Basin supports extensive populations of black swans. However, it is less common in central and northern Australia.\n\nThis graceful bird thrives in a variety of habitats, including fresh, brackish, and saltwater lakes, swamps, and rivers that provide both food and nesting materials. The black swan can be found in permanent wetlands, ornamental lakes, flooded pastures, tidal mudflats, and occasionally near islands or the open sea.\n\nWhile the black swan was initially believed to be sedentary, it is now known for its highly nomadic nature. Instead of a set migratory pattern, these swans respond opportunistically to factors such as rainfall or drought. In years of high rainfall, emigration occurs from the southwest and southeast into the interior, followed by a reverse migration in drier years. During periods of rainfall in arid central regions, black swans migrate to nest and raise their young. However, if dry conditions return before the young are raised, the adults will abandon the nests, eggs, or cygnets and return to wetter areas.\n\nLike many waterfowl, black swans undergo a molting process after breeding, during which they lose all their flight feathers simultaneously and are unable to fly for about a month. During this period, they typically settle on large, open waters for safety.\n\nThe black swan has a vast range, with estimates ranging from 1 to 10 million square kilometers as its extent of occurrence. The current global population is estimated to be up to 500,000 individuals. Fortunately, there is no identified threat of extinction or significant decline in population for this widespread and numerous bird.\n\nEuropean explorers first encountered black swans in 1697 during Willem de Vlamingh's expedition when exploring the Swan River in Western Australia.","bird_eco":"**Diet and Feeding:**\nThe black swan primarily follows a herbivorous diet, displaying some regional and seasonal variations. The main food sources include aquatic and marshland plants. In wetlands of New South Wales, the leaf of reedmace (genus Typha) is a crucial component, supplemented by submerged algae and aquatic plants like Vallisneria. In Queensland, dominant foods include aquatic plants such as Potamogeton, stoneworts, and algae. During flood situations, when usual foods are inaccessible, black swans resort to feeding on pasture plants on the shore. The feeding behavior involves dipping the head and neck underwater, keeping the head flat against the bottom while maintaining a horizontal body position in shallow water. In deeper water, the swan up-ends to reach lower depths, and they can also filter feed at the water's surface.\n\n**Nesting and Reproduction:**\nSimilar to other swans, the black swan is largely monogamous, forming pair bonds for life with a divorce rate of about 6%. Recent studies indicate that approximately a third of all broods exhibit extra-pair paternity. Surprisingly, an estimated one-quarter of all pairings involve homosexual partnerships, mainly between males. These swans may form temporary threesomes with females to obtain eggs, often driving away the female after she lays the eggs. Nesting typically occurs in the wetter winter months (February to September) in the Southern hemisphere, occasionally in large colonies. The nest is a sizable heap or mound of reeds, grasses, and weeds, with a diameter between 1 and 1.5 meters and a height of up to 1 meter, situated in shallow water or on islands. The nest is reused, restored, or rebuilt annually as needed. Both male and female swans share the care of the nest. A typical clutch contains four to eight greenish-white eggs, incubated for about 35\u201340 days. Both parents take turns incubating, with the female primarily incubating at night. The transition between incubation periods involves ritualized displays by both sexes. If eggs accidentally roll out of the nest, both parents retrieve them using their necks. Similar to other swans, black swans vigorously defend their nests with their wings and beaks. After hatching, the cygnets are cared for by the parents for about nine months until they fledge, occasionally riding on their parent's back for longer trips into deeper water. However, this behavior is less frequent in black swans compared to mute and black-necked swans.","bird_img":["blackswan.jpeg"],"bird_scale":6}

The black vulture favors open landscapes interspersed with wooded or brush-covered areas. Its habitat preferences include moist lowland forests, shrublands, grasslands, wetlands, swamps, pastures, and extensively degraded former forests. While it predominantly occupies lowlands, sightings in mountainous areas are infrequent. This bird is commonly observed soaring in the sky or perched on fence posts or dead trees.","bird_eco":"The black vulture engages in soaring flights, searching for food by holding its wings horizontally while gliding. It employs short bursts of flapping followed by periods of gliding during flight. Although its flight is less efficient compared to other vultures due to shorter wings, the black vulture compensates by flapping its wings more frequently, particularly when compared to the turkey vulture. This species is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, reducing its takeoff weight and assisting in predator deterrence. Similar to other New World vultures, the black vulture practices urohidrosis, cooling itself by defecating on its legs, which facilitates the evaporation of water in the feces and\/or urine. While generally silent, it can emit hisses and grunts when agitated or during feeding. Being gregarious, the black vulture roosts in large groups, often sharing roosting sites with turkey vultures where their ranges overlap.\n\nIn addition to its distinctive flight behavior, the black vulture is often observed standing in a spread-winged stance, which serves multiple functions such as drying its wings, warming its body, and inhibiting bacterial growth. The timing of the breeding season varies with latitude, with courtship rituals performed on the ground. Nesting typically occurs in wooded areas, hollow logs, or other cavities, rarely exceeding 3 meters above the ground. The black vulture lays eggs without using nesting materials but may decorate the surroundings with colorful items. Clutch size ranges from one to three eggs, with both parents incubating them for 28 to 41 days. The young vultures, covered in buffy down, remain in the nest for two months and achieve skilled flight after 75 to 80 days.\n\nFeeding primarily on carrion, the black vulture plays a vital role in ecosystem balance by disposing of carcasses. It locates food by sight or by following other New World vultures to carcasses. While aggressive during feeding, it may chase the larger turkey vulture from carcasses. In areas populated by humans, the black vulture may scavenge at garbage dumps, consume eggs, fruit, fish, dung, and ripe or decomposing plant material. It can also prey on newborn or incapacitated mammals and is known to harass cows giving birth, primarily preying on newborn calves, lambs, and piglets. The black vulture exhibits remarkable resistance to pathogenic microorganisms and their toxins, employing various mechanisms such as the secretion of antimicrobial agents and the role of the normal microbiota.","bird_img":["blackvulture.jpg"],"bird_scale":5}

The males have a wing length of 63.5\u201367.5 mm, a tail length of 58\u201363 mm, a bill length of 8\u20139.5 mm, and a tarsus length of 16\u201317 mm. Females are slightly smaller on average, with corresponding measurements.\n\nWhile the black-capped chickadee closely resembles the Carolina chickadee in appearance, subtle differences exist. The black-capped chickadee's wing edges are somewhat paler, and its bib has a \"messier\" border. The most reliable method of differentiation is through vocalizations. The black-capped chickadee has a two-part fee-bee song, whereas the Carolina chickadee's song consists of three parts.\n\nAdditionally, the black-capped chickadee is somewhat similar to mountain chickadees and boreal chickadees. Mountain chickadees feature a distinct white stripe above their eyes, while boreal chickadees have a brown cap instead of the black cap found in black-capped chickadees.\n\nThe vocalizations of the black-capped chickadee are intricate, comprising 16 distinct types conveying various information. Notably, the two-note fee-bee song is a clear whistle produced by males. The familiar chick-a-dee-dee-dee call is complex, consisting of up to four distinct units arranged in different patterns to communicate information about threats and group coordination. The number of \"dees\" in the call indicates the level of threat from nearby predators.\n\nSocial learning plays a significant role in the development of the gargle noise, a complex call used by males to indicate threats or in sexual contexts. Chickadees adapt their song frequencies in response to ambient noise, matching the frequencies of nearby individuals or adjusting to noisy environments to communicate effectively.

They maintain a consistent habitat throughout both breeding and non-breeding seasons. However, during the winter, irregular irruptions may occur, potentially leading to variations in their presence in specific locations.","bird_eco":"Black-capped chickadees exhibit a diverse diet, with insects, especially caterpillars, constituting a significant portion during the summer. They showcase remarkable foraging behaviors, including hopping along tree branches, sometimes hanging upside down or hovering, and making short flights to catch insects in the air. In winter, the focus shifts to seeds and berries, with occasional consumption of insect eggs, pupae, and even the fat from deceased mammals. Notably, they readily take sunflower seeds from bird feeders, employing a distinctive technique of hammering the seed on a branch to open it.\n\nThese birds engage in caching food, storing items such as seeds and insects in various locations like bark, dead leaves, and conifer needles. Their impressive memory for cache locations can last up to 28 days, and they can even remember the relative quality of stored items within the first 24 hours.\n\nBlack-capped chickadees are non-migratory but may experience variations in their presence during winter, influenced by factors like wind and temperature. In regions with harsh winters, such as Minnesota, access to supplemental food, like bird feeders, significantly impacts their winter survival rates. These birds demonstrate a unique capacity for torpor on cold nights, allowing them to reduce their body temperature by as much as 12\u00b0C to conserve energy.\n\nDuring winter, black-capped chickadees often form flocks with other bird species, enhancing foraging efficiency. They sleep in thick vegetation or cavities, typically singly, although they may occasionally roost together. Their flight is characterized by slightly undulating movements with rapid wing beats, and they tend to avoid large open areas.\n\nMolting occurs once a year, with a partial postjuvenal molt at the end of the first summer, involving only body feathers and wing coverts. Nesting takes place in tree cavities, with females choosing nest sites and both sexes participating in cavity excavation. The nesting season spans from late April through June, and the eggs, typically six to eight in number, undergo incubation by the female for 11-14 days.\n\nBlack-capped chickadees, socially monogamous, exhibit a dominance hierarchy within winter flocks. The hierarchies are linear and stable, with older and more experienced birds generally being dominant. Reproductive success is linked to the higher ranking of males. They may interbreed with other chickadee species where their ranges overlap, and dominance hierarchies play a crucial role in determining social behaviors within flocks.\n\nThese birds face predation primarily from birds of prey such as owls, hawks, and shrikes, as well as nest predation by raccoons, squirrels, opossums, and snakes. House wrens may raid nest sites, destroying chickadee eggs for reuse. Black-capped chickadees are susceptible to West Nile Virus, blood parasites causing malaria, and avian keratin disorder, although high rates of infection have not been observed.","bird_img":["blackcappedchickadee.jpg"],"bird_scale":2}

Spring migration typically occurs from late April to May, while fall migration happens from late August to September. During migration, they can be found in various habitats, including woodlands, parks, and gardens.\n\nNoteworthy for their robust, high-pitched songs, Blackburnian Warblers are also skilled invertebrate feeders, adept at catching insects in the air or gleaning them from leaves and branches. Despite their relatively larger size for a warbler species, they are delicate and sensitive to habitat disturbance.","bird_eco":"Blackburnian warblers exhibit distinct behavior patterns throughout the year. During winter, they are solitary, territorial on breeding grounds, and generally avoid interaction with other passerine species except during migration. In transit, they often join mixed foraging flocks with species like chickadees, kinglets, and nuthatches. While wintering in the tropics, they maintain a solitary disposition from other passerines.\n\nPrimarily insectivorous, these warblers incorporate berries into their winter diet. Their foraging style involves searching for insects or spiders in treetops. During the breeding season, their diet is dominated by Lepidoptera larvae, contributing to pest control, particularly against the spruce budworm. In Ontario, 98% of their diet comprises insects, with the remaining 2% being spiders. Among migratory Setophaga warblers, the Blackburnian warbler is considered a specialist in foraging in the micro-habitat of the tree's top canopy.\n\nBreeding habitats encompass mature coniferous woodlands, with a central breeding range in the southeastern portion of Canada's boreal forest. Their distribution extends down New England and the Appalachian Mountains, favoring elevated mixed woodlands containing spruce and hemlocks. The species winters in tropical montane forests, primarily from Colombia to Peru, sporadically in Panama and the Amazon region.\n\nBreeding typically starts in mid-May to early June in the contiguous United States and slightly later in Quebec. Nest construction involves an open cup of twigs, bark, plant fibers, and rootlets held to a branch with spider webs, lined with lichens, moss, hair, and dead pine needles. While they usually lay one brood per year, they can produce additional broods if the nest is destroyed. The nest, located 2\u201338 meters above the ground on a horizontal branch, may contain three to five whitish eggs. The female primarily broods, spending about 80% of the day actively brooding, with the male assisting in food provision. Predators include brown-headed cowbirds at the nest and potential threats from blue jays, American red squirrels, merlins, sharp-shinned hawks, and Cooper's hawks. The primary threat to the species is habitat destruction, which could lead to significant habitat loss for breeding and wintering grounds.

Distinguished by differences in bill morphology, head plume length, and complete lack of pigment in its plumage, the Great White Heron averages somewhat larger than other subspecies. Male Great White Herons in Florida have been observed to average 3.02 kg (6.7 lb), while females average 2.57 kg (5.7 lb). These birds primarily inhabit saltwater environments and were once considered a separate species. Birds displaying intermediate characteristics between the normal and white morphs are known as W\u00fcrdemann's Herons.\n\nThe potential separation of the Great White Heron as a distinct species (A. occidentalis) from the Great Blue Heron has garnered support, notably from David Sibley.\n\nIn terms of similar species, the Great Blue Heron can be differentiated from the Great Egret by its larger size and yellow legs, as opposed to the Great Egret's black legs. Additionally, it distinguishes itself from the Reddish Egret and Little Blue Heron by its larger size and the absence of white on the head and yellow in the bill. In regions where its range overlaps with the Cocoi Heron, particularly in Colombia and Panama, the Great Blue Heron can be distinguished by its lack of a striking white neck and solid black crown, traits characteristic of the Cocoi Heron. While occasionally confused with the slightly smaller Grey Heron, which may appear as vagrants on northern coasts of North America, the Great Blue Heron can be differentiated by its distinct plumage, particularly the solidly soft-gray neck of the Grey Heron. It's worth noting that despite occasional misnomers, the Great Blue Heron is not a crane; its curved neck during flight distinguishes it from the straight neck of a crane.","bird_distr":"The Great Blue Heron maintains a widespread presence throughout much of North America, ranging as far north as Alaska and the southern Canadian provinces during the summer months. As winter approaches, their range extends southward, encompassing Florida, Mexico, and the Caribbean, with occasional sightings reaching far northwestern South America, particularly in Colombia and Venezuela. While migratory populations east of the Rocky Mountains typically winter in coastal areas of the Southern United States, Central America, or northern South America, those residing in the Southern United States and along the lower Pacific coast remain year-round residents. Remarkably, some individuals display remarkable hardiness, enduring cold northern winters as long as fish-bearing waters remain unfrozen, often limited to flowing water such as streams, creeks, and rivers.\n\nAdaptable to a variety of wetland habitats, the Great Blue Heron can be found in abundance in fresh and saltwater marshes, mangrove swamps, flooded meadows, lake edges, and shorelines. Their adaptability extends to heavily developed areas, provided they harbor bodies of fish-bearing water.\n\nWhile Great Blue Herons typically remain close to bodies of water, they may occasionally be observed flying over upland areas. They commonly nest in trees or bushes near the water's edge, with a preference for islands or partially isolated spots, which reduce the risk of predation.\n\nAlthough primarily distributed across North America, the Great Blue Heron has been recorded as a vagrant in various locations worldwide, including England, Greenland, Hawaii, and the Azores.\n\nThe Great White Heron, a subspecies unique to South Florida, including the Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge in the Florida Keys, represents a distinctive regional variation of the Great Blue Heron.","bird_eco":"The Great Blue Heron, with fish as its primary food source, exhibits a versatile diet that includes various sizes of fish, ranging from small fingerlings to large adults measuring up to 60 cm (24 in) in length and weighing approximately 900 g (2.0 lb). While they favor small to medium-sized fish measuring around 10\u201320 cm (3.9\u20137.9 in), their diet varies based on the availability and abundance of prey species. For instance, in Nova Scotia, flounder comprises 98% of their diet, while in British Columbia, they primarily consume sticklebacks, gunnels, sculpins, and perch. In California, their diet consists mainly of sculpin, bass, perch, flounder, and top smelt.\n\nIn addition to fish, Great Blue Herons opportunistically prey on a wide range of other species. They readily consume amphibians such as leopard frogs, American bullfrogs, toads, and salamanders, as well as reptiles like small turtles, snakes, and lizards. Aquatic crustaceans such as crayfish, shrimp, and crabs, along with grasshoppers, dragonflies, and other aquatic insects, serve as supplementary prey. They also target small mammals including shrews, rats, ground squirrels, and moles. Studies have shown a significant portion of their diet consisting of voles in some areas, with occasional predation on muskrats, long-tailed weasels, and even eastern cottontails. While less common, Great Blue Herons may also prey on birds such as black rails, phalaropes, American dippers, pied-billed grebes, and chicks of marsh terns.\n\nLocating their prey primarily by sight, Great Blue Herons typically swallow their prey whole but may occasionally choke on prey that is too large. They are generally solitary feeders, foraging while standing in water, fields, or by dropping from the air or perching into water. Occasionally, they form loose feeding flocks, facilitating the location of fish schools more efficiently.\n\nAs adept wading birds, Great Blue Herons can feed in deeper waters, accessing niche areas not accessible to most other heron species. While they typically feed in shallow waters less than 50 cm (20 in) deep or at the water's edge, they are also known to hunt during both day and night, particularly around dawn and dusk. Their hunting technique typically involves wading slowly through shallow water and swiftly spearing fish or frogs with their long, sharp bills. While usually slow and deliberate in their movements, they exhibit adaptability in their fishing methods, including standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over the water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the water, and swimming or floating on the surface.\n\nRegarding breeding behavior, Great Blue Herons typically nest in colonies, often in trees near lakes or other wetlands, with colonies ranging in size from five to 500 nests. These colonies, known as heronries, are usually situated relatively close to ideal feeding spots, within 4 to 5 km (2.5 to 3.1 mi). While they primarily reuse nests, individuals often choose new mates each breeding season. The bulky stick nests, constructed by both males and females, can grow to impressive sizes over repeated use. Each breeding season, females lay three to six pale blue eggs, which hatch asynchronously over several days. Both parents feed the young at the nest by regurgitating food, with the first chick to hatch often growing more quickly due to increased food handling experience and aggressive interactions with siblings. Predators of eggs and nestlings include turkey vultures, common ravens, American crows, red-tailed hawks, American black bears, and raccoons, with bald eagles known to attack Great Blue Herons at every stage of their lifecycle. Despite the potential threats, adult herons have few natural predators due to their large size and sharp beaks, with instances of predation being rare.","bird_img":["blueheron.jpeg"],"bird_scale":6}

C. aereus aereus features a greenish and blue tail, wings, and back, while C. aereus flavirostris showcases a blue tail, wings, and back.\n\nPrimarily an insectivore, the Blue Malkoha's diet consists mainly of caterpillars, beetles, grasshoppers, and crickets, supplemented by frogs, slugs, fruit, seeds, and leaves. It navigates through dense vegetation with a series of small hops, seizing prey as it traverses its habitat. It is known to associate with other birds and squirrels, capitalizing on insects flushed by them.\n\nIn contrast to certain other cuckoos, the Blue Malkoha does not exhibit brood parasitism; instead, it nurtures its own offspring. The species typically lays two white and creamy eggs in a nest constructed from a rough mass of sticks, suspended around 2\u20135 meters above the ground. Both parents partake in the care of the young.\n\nWhile the Blue Malkoha is an uncommon species and often elusive due to its secretive behavior, it is not currently considered threatened. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists it as least concern, reflecting its stable population status.","bird_distr":"The Blue Malkoha (Phaenicophaeus sumatranus) is a striking medium-sized bird indigenous to Southeast Asia, with its habitat spanning from the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. Renowned for its dazzling blue plumage and unique vocalizations, it is a sought-after sight for bird enthusiasts.\n\nTypically, these birds inhabit lowland forests, secondary forests, and open woodlands. Additionally, they are known to occupy bamboo forests, plantations, and mangroves within their range. Their preferred habitats boast dense vegetation and an abundance of trees, providing ample opportunities for perching and nesting.","bird_eco":"The Blue Malkoha is primarily insectivorous, with its diet consisting of various insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, and beetles. Additionally, they occasionally consume lizards, small snakes, and frogs, while also supplementing their diet with fruits and berries on occasion.\n\nIn terms of behavior, these birds are typically solitary outside of the breeding season. They are known for their vocal nature, with males emitting a loud, piercing \"kok-kok-kok\" call. When foraging, they actively search for food in the middle and upper levels of the forest canopy. Their agile flying abilities enable them to make swift turns and navigate adeptly through dense foliage.\n\nDuring the breeding season, Blue Malkohas form monogamous pairs. They construct simple platform nests in trees, where the female lays 2-3 eggs. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs for approximately 17-18 days. After hatching, the chicks fledge after about 30-35 days and become independent shortly thereafter.","bird_img":["bluemalkoha.jpg"],"bird_scale":4}
